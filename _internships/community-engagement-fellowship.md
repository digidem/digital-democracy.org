Digital Democracy’s mission is to empower marginalized communities to use technology to defend their rights. We build tools with our indigenous partners across South America to empower frontline action on human rights and the environment, achieving transformative change. Equipped with the tools they need, our partners become better storytellers, advocates and leaders in their  work for a more just and equitable world. At Dd, we believe that **change does not come from technology, but from how people use it**.  See See our [website](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mission/) for more.

## About the Fellowship

Digital Democracy (Dd) is looking for a highly talented and passionate individual to join our team as Community Engagement Fellow in spring 2016. The Fellow will design and deploy communications about Digital Democracy’s work to our supporters, creating opportunities for individuals to give time, technical talents, and financial resources to advance our human rights work.

We are offering a modest monthly stipend for this part time (10-20 hours a week) position for up to an initial six month commitment. The exact length of this fellowship is negotiable, and includes the opportunity to extend the fellowship into a longer paid fellowship or full or part-time position.

Candidates who identify as a member of a marginalized community are strongly urged to apply.

### Required Qualifications

The ideal candidate will have experience in communications and fundraising, and be excited to find and engage with people aligned with Dd’s mission. Specifically, the ideal candidate should:

- Be a **clear and compelling communicator**.
- Be a **quick learner**, able to learn about Digital Democracy’s work and share our story with others.
- Be a **self-directed problem solver**.
- Have **experience writing emails and other communication** for a mission-driven organization.
- Have **experience in nonprofit fundraising** and/or willingness to learn.
- Have **computer savvy**. Coding experience is not required, but you must be able to use email, spreadsheets, Google Drive, Dropbox, Mailchimp, and generally have a curiosity for technology. It’s ok not to know a particular tool, but you must be excited to learn.
- **Share our values**. You have a passion for human rights and the environment, and you believe in the power of ordinary people to accomplish extraordinary things. You’re excited to help others contribute to an organization that is empowering grassroots communities around the globe.
- Be able to work from **Oakland, California**. You should be able to work part-time out of our transit-accessible co-working space in Uptown Oakland.

### Preferred Qualifications

The ideal candidate will have some or most of the following.

- **Social media expertise**. Use of Twitter/Facebook/Instagram for organizations/brands.
- **Design skills**. Basic graphics, photo editing, website design, etc.
- **Event planning**. Experience planning events and/or enthusiasm to do so.
- **Experience writing** op-eds and distributing press releases.
- **International experience** and non-English language skills.

### Potential Projects

Digital Democracy will produce several opportunities for individuals to engage our our work in 2016. The successful candidate will lead events and campaigns, such as:

- **Support the Mesh Network**. Digital Democracy’s Mesh Network is a group of individuals who provide financial and networking support. The fellow will be responsible for formalizing this group, implementing and documenting best practices for engagement, and to conduct outreach during their fellowship period.
- **Local hackathons and code sprints**. In addition to hackathons we conduct in the field with our indigenous partners, our work often requires the dedicated focus of our more technical supporters in the form of a US-based hackathon or code sprint. The fellow will work with other Dd staff to recruit and manage participants, as well as support in setting up partnerships, venue and other logistics.
- **Happy hours and Meetups**. When it complements our work, bringing together supporters for informal gatherings can strengthen our network and create giving opportunities. We will look to our fellow to identify and orchestrate opportunities for informal gatherings, also with key support from Digital Democracy staff as needed.

## Our Team
Our small but growing team is based in the Bay Area, California. This position will work part time out of our shared co-working space. You will report directly to Dd’s Executive Director and collaborate with other staff members where appropriate.

### Perks

- **Flexible schedule and hours**. Some of your time will be based in our co-working space in Oakland, the rest can be based on what works for you.
- **Hands on learning about Dd’s innovative tools and approach**. Opportunity to work closely with Dd’s Executive Director and help influence the shape of our communications, educational programming and individual giving.
- **The opportunity to grow** the fellowship into a longer-term staff position.
