**Kira Oakley** works with Digital Democracy to build useful open tools that
raise the bar of the commons, especially for marginalized communities.

She creates and maintains open technology that enables self-determination,
honors people over profit, that is sustainable for the communities that adopt
it, and is accessible regardless of resources or technical background.

Kira is based in Oakland, CA.
