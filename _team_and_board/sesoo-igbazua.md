Sesoo is an accounting and finance professional with a zeal for social change.

A double graduate of Howard University (BBA and MBA), he has honed his skills and gathered a wealth of experience working in the Big 4 accounting space and several large and medium-sized non-profits in the Washington DC area.

When he is not knee-deep in the books, he can be found chasing after his two little boys or cooking with his wife in their home in the Deanwood neighborhood.
