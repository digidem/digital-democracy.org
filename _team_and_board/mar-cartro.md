**Mar Cartró-Sabaté**, Program Associate, is an environmental scientist with rich experience in community-engaged research, premised upon participatory methodologies and collaborative approaches. She holds a Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences, and she has always stood for participatory action research, in which Indigenous communities set the research agenda, addressing issues of concern to them, creating bonds of mutual training and knowledge exchange through shared knowledge-seeking and socially transformative endeavors. She is inspired by the growing philosophy of decolonizing methodologies and the expanding citizen science initiatives (she co-created [Amazonoil](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marcartro/amazonoil/about/research)) and believes in the power of technology to address environmental and social injustices through community empowerment. Her research shows how Indigenous monitoring programs in the Peruvian Amazon can push the frontiers of scientific knowledge while contributing to defending Indigenous territories from the pervasive impacts of oil extraction. She is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
