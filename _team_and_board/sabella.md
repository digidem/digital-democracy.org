**Sabella Flagg** is the lead UX Designer at Digital Democracy. She uses design thinking and research to design tools for diverse and oft overlooked communities. For 10+ years she has worked extensively throughout the tech industry at a variety of design agencies and innovation consultancies and is particularly interested in projects that create positive social impact.

Sabella holds a BFA in Design from Drake University and after hours she can be found creating art under the moniker “the monarq”, consuming all things horror-related, and listening to podcasts non-stop.
