Aliya Ryan, Program Director, believes that communities flourish because of the quality of the relationships they have with the people and environment around them and is passionate about supporting them to strengthen and widen these. Since graduating from Cambridge in Social Anthropology Aliya has worked with groups as diverse as indigenous peoples in the Amazon, where she co-founded the non-profit Shinai, to an educational establishment in the Scottish Borders and marginalized minority ethnic communities in Edinburgh. Aliya is motivated by a passion for social and environmental justice and grassroots advocacy. She recently completed an MSc in gastronomy, which focused on the knowledge, resources and entitlements necessary to build sustainable futures. Aliya is delighted to be working with Digital Democracy on their Ecuador programme to support the Waorani and Siekopai territory mapping projects. Aliya is based in Edinburgh, UK.
