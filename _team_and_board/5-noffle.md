**Stephen Whitmore** works with Digital Democracy to build useful
open tools that raise the bar of the commons, especially for marginalized
communities.

Stephen creates and maintains open technology that enables self-determination;
honors people, not profit; is sustainable for the communities that adopt it;
and is maximally accessible regardless of resources or technical background.
