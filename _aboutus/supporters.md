Transformative change never comes from a single individual or organization.
Working off our core value of collaboration, Digital Democracy recognizes that
we are part of a greater ecosystem of people and groups working for a more just
and sustainable world. We accomplish our mission thanks to the generous support
of individual and institutional donors and high-impact partnerships with
a range of partners, from local grassroots organizations to international
solidarity organizations who share our commitment to centering & amplifying marginalized
communities working to defend their human and environmental rights.

## Local Partners

We work alongside local partners to offer direct support to indigenous communities, local mappers and community environmental monitors. The design and development of the tools we build is led by this work with our local partners. Currently we are working closely with the following local and indigenous organisations:

### Peru:

Pueblos Indígenas Amazónicos Unidos en Defensa de sus Territorios ([PUINAMUDT](http://observatoriopetrolero.org)) - a platform including members of four indigenous representative organisations in Northern Peru, made up of Kichwa, Achuar and Cocama Cocamilla peoples (FEDIQUEP, FECONACOR, OPIKAFPE, ACODECOSPAT).

Technical Executor of the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve ([ECA-RCA](http://eca-amarakaeri.org.pe)) - an organisation representing Harakmbut, Matsigenka and Yine communities in the co-management of the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve in Southern Peru.

### Ecuador:

[Alianza Ceibo](https://www.alianzaceibo.org), an indigenous organisation bringing together Cofan, Siona, Seikopai and Waorani peoples in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon.

### Guyana:

South Rupununi District Council ([SRDC](http://wapichanao.communitylands.org/index.html)), an indigenous organisation of Wapichan and Makushi peoples located in South Western Guyana.
