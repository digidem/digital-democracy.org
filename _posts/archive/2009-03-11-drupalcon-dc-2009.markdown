Last week Mark traveled to Washington DC to attend [Drupalcon](http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/), an unconference_for [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) users and developers.

Drupal is an open-source content management platform, with which we're considering building the [VCC](http://www.dtwo.org/programming/). The users that attended this event had the opportunity to learn how to use the platform from the people that are creating the code, and meet potential partners, while the developers had a forum for discussing the future of Drupal. In addition, it was an arena for the best in the field to come together to brainstorm ways of changing Drupal to make it a better resource. Mark was able to talk to users about the platform's pros and cons to get an idea of whether it's the best fit for the VCC, as well as view demonstrations and hear about new ideas and advances, information which will help us decide whether it's developing in ways that will be advantageous to use with our future programming.

Drupalcon was sold out, with more than 1300 attendees.

It was the #1 trend on Twitter during the 4 day event. Drupalcon goers tweeted about topics including the keynote addresses, the smaller sessions and the food, as well as posting numerous photos as the event progressed, and communicating with other attendees about potential meet-ups.
