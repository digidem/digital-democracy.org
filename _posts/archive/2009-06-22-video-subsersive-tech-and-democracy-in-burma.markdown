In April we collaborated with [Not An Alternative](http://www.notanalternative.net/) and [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org/) to host an event for their [Upgrade!](http://upgrade.eyebeam.org/) series highlighting [the role that technology plays in the Burmese democracy movement](http://www.dtwo.org/2009/05/01/a-great-night-for-burma-and-subversive-tech/). Hosted at the [Change You Want To See](http://thechangeyouwanttosee.com/) gallery space, the event was live-streamed, and the video has just gone up. We are pleased to share it.





Part 1: An overview of the situation in Burma and beginning of Q & A.

Many thanks again to everyone from Not An Alternative and Eyebeam who helped make the original event such a success and for recording and uploading the video.
