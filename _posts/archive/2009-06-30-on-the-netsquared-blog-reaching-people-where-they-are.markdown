NetSquared's [Alex Steed](http://alexsteed.com/) interviewed D2's co-director Emily Jacobi last week about D2's experiences representing [Handheld Human Rights](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/handheld-human-rights) at [N2Y4](http://www.netsquared.org/conference/n2y4). He also took the opportunity to ask Emily and John Zoltner of [DatAgro](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/datagro) about why both of our projects use SMS despite the current fascination about smartphones.

For us, choosing a technology platform is all about reaching people where they are. Read more on Alex's post on [Developing SMS Infrastructue in a shiny-new-thing world](http://www.netsquared.org/blog/alexsteed/developing-sms-infrastructure-shiny-new-thing-would).
