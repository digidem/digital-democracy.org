On Monday, April 27th D2 co-hosted a packed event with [Not an Alternative](http://www.notanalternative.net/wordpress/) and [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org/) at their [Change You Want to See](http://thechangeyouwanttosee.com/) gallery in Brooklyn as part of their project [Upgrade!](http://upgrade.eyebeam.org/), a monthly series focusing on open-source activism and art. We had a fantastic turnout and met a lot of great people.

Mark started things off with a [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/mbelinsky/subversive-technology-burmas-struggle-for-democracy) on the situation in Burma and D2's work with community organizations on the borders.

The evening's main event was a question and answer session with Stanley, head of the the [All Burma IT Students' Union](http://www.abitsu.org/), one of our local Burmese partners. Stanley talked about his early career in Burma where he taught computer science, his work with the underground democracy movement, his run-ins with the military police and his arrest and eventual escape to Thailand in 2003. Talk then turned to his current work with ABITSU and the floor was opened up to the audience for questions.

Thanks to everyone who came out to the event and stayed to talk afterwards. Thanks also to Not an Alternative and Eyebeam for helping produce the event and a very special thank you to Stanley for sharing his inspiring life and work with us.
