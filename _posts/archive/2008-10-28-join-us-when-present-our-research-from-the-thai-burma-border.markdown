What are the challenges, hopes and dreams of the next generation of Burmese youth activists? In March 2007, Digital Democracy's co-directors Mark Belinsky and Emily Jacobi joined a research team from the Center for Peace Building International to investigate the situation of Burmese youth along the Thai-Burma Border.

Over 90 young people were interviewed for the comprehensive report, Overcoming Obstacles, Creating Opportunities: Youth Perspectives from the Thai-Burma Border. The report is available for download [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/overcoming-obstacles-creating-opportunities4.pdf).

To launch the report, a photo essay and film, our co-directors will be presenting for [Center for Peacebuilding International](http://www.cpbinternational.org/) (CPBI) at the Women's Commission in New York City and the US Institute for Peace in Washington, DC on Supporting Displaced Youth around Burma's Borders. See below for details on the NY event.
