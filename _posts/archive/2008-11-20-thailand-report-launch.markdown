**Overcoming Obstacles, Creating Opportunities:
Presenting the Situation of Displaced Burmese Youth in Thailand**

Last year, the [Center for Peace Building International (CPBI)](http://www.cpbinternational.org/) sent a team to research the situation and perspectives of youth living on the Thai-Burma border. Now, CPBI invites the international NGO community to share in the Burma Youth Project’s work with this report.

Overcoming Obstacles, Creating Opportunities details the experiences of displaced youth from Burma living on the Thai-Burma border during the spring of 2007, featuring youth voices and testimonials and focusing on several organizations working to educate, support and empower them in their work.

Download the report in PDF format below.
