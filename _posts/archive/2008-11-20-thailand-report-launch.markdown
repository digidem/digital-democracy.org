**Overcoming Obstacles, Creating Opportunities:
Presenting the Situation of Displaced Burmese Youth in Thailand**

Last year, the [Center for Peace Building International (CPBI)](http://www.cpbinternational.org/) sent a team to research the situation and perspectives of youth living on the Thai-Burma border. Now, CPBI invites the international NGO community to share in the Burma Youth Projectâ€™s work with this report.

Overcoming Obstacles, Creating Opportunities details the experiences of displaced youth from Burma living on the Thai-Burma border during the spring of 2007, featuring youth voices and testimonials and focusing on several organizations working to educate, support and empower them in their work.
