On Monday, April 27th at 7:30 D2 is hosting an event here in New York on the use of digital technology in the Burmese pro-democracy movement: "[Subversive Tech and Burma's Struggle for Democracy](http://thechangeyouwanttosee.com/event/subversive-tech-burmas-struggle-democracy)".

The evening's program will include:

- A presentation by Digital Democracy on the use of technology inside and along Burma's borders.
- Footage from the Sept. 2007 Saffron Revolution, where tech such as mobile phones and the internet allowed protesters to coordinate and publicize the largest protests seen in a generation,
- A Q&A with "Stanley", a Burmese computer programmer and chairperson of the [All Burma IT Students Union](http://www.abitsu.org).

The space and equipment to make this event possible are being generously provided by [The Change You Want to See](http://thechangeyouwanttosee.com/) gallery, a co-working space for artists and activists in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The gallery is located at 84 Havemeyer St in Brooklyn a few blocks south of the Bedford Ave stop on the L train. If you're not in New York on Monday or can't make it out you can still take part in the event by watching the live streaming video.

For more information about the event, the space and the participants check out the invitation [here](http://thechangeyouwanttosee.com/event/subversive-tech-burmas-struggle-democracy).

Hope to see you there!
