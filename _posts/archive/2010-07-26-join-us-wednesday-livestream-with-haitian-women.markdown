I'm in Port-au-Prince, Haiti for the next week to follow-up on the great trip [Abby Goldberg](http://twitter.com/digiabby) and I took this spring. I began my trip distributing cameras for the [Life In A Day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMxuocCN1O0) project - the first user-generated feature film. I've also been distributing photos from our [workshop in April](/archive/reflections-from-a-week-among-haitis-women/) and I ferried some films from NY for the awesome folks at [FilmAid](http://www.filmaid.org/) to show in the camps.

But most importantly, I'm meeting with some of the amazing grassroots women's groups who are working to combat gender-based violence in the camps. Their stories are sometimes harrowing and often inspiring, and I don't just want to speak with them myself - I want you to speak with them too.

On Wednesday, Digital Democracy is hosting an event at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. Come join us for a livestream discussion with Haitian women, music, drinks and more.
