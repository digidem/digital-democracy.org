Behold the third episode of #DdTv! In this episode we travel to Brooklyn to meet with [Soliya](http://soliya.net/), an organization that's working to empower young adults to bridge the divide between Western and Muslim societies using new media. Outreach Manager Reem Marto explains the lack of access for kids in the Middle East, and how Soliya's Connect Program is working to tackle these issues.
