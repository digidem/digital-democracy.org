We just entered our Virtual Community Center (VCC) project into the [2008 Development 2.0 Challenge](http://www.netsquared.org/challenges) being presented by NetSquared and USAID. The mission of USAID is to:


##### “jumpstart the leading edge of online technological change -- and to help nonprofits use that edge to change the world.”


and is promoting this mission through this contest by,


##### “challenging organizations to explore the potential of emerging technologies through an innovation for maximum impact in areas such as health, education and other development issues.”


**[Vote](http://www.netsquared.org/usaid/vote) for our project**! The grant selection process is **interactive**. Interested individuals (that means you!) can learn about cutting edge projects and vote for what they’re interested in. After users choose the top 15, those picks then go on to be reviewed by a panel of judges. We’d love your support! The process is easy and fun: just go to the website, register, login, browse the posted projects, and cast your vote

The voting doesn’t last long; it runs from Monday December 8th at 9:00am (PST) – Friday December 12th at 5:00pm (PST) so be sure to vote soon before the period ends!

We entered our proposal for the D2 Virtual Community Center because we believe our project has the potential to greatly help community groups communicate and collaborate across barriers.  By voting, you can help make this dream a reality.
