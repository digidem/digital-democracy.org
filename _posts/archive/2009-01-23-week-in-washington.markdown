Our co-directors spent this past week in Washington D.C., witnessing
history and looking to the future as responsible citizens. D2 presented
our research on technology in closed societies and had several
exciting meetings with groups doing incredible work, some of whom
might turn out to be great partners. Inspired by the quick call to
action of our new President, we too have hit the ground running in the
new year.
