Abby and I just returned from an inspiring and full week in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We couldn't have done it without your support, and we're thrilled to announce that, thanks to a donation we received this week, we have met our fundraising goal of $7,500 for the trip! Thanks to all the donations, we were able to leave four digital cameras with women's organizations in Port-au-Prince.

We have many notes to process and photos to edit - check out some sneak previews on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitaldemocracy/), and stay tuned for upcoming blog posts about the trip.
