Huge thanks to the 58 backers who helped us reach and exceed our goal for our [Little Brother vs. Big Brother](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1033999452/little-brother-vs-big-brother/) campaign. Thanks to their support, we'll be translating [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/bio.php)'s [Little Brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/about/) into four Burmese languages.![little_brother-4x3b](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/little_brother-4x3b2-300x225.png)

We used [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) to run the campaign and we're extremely happy with the results. Kickstarter is a funding platform that includes rewards for people who back the project, a way to send frequent updates, and an all-or-nothing deadline that encourages people to contribute in order to guarantee a project's success.

We are so grateful to our backers! Thanks for making the project a success.
