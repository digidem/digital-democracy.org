Thanks to all our friends, partners, advisors & supporters who joined us last Thursday for Digital Democracy's 3rd Birthday Party. We are so grateful we were able to celebrate with all of you.

[Photos from the event](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitaldemocracy/) are up on our Flickr ... check out the excellent images by Jon Reznick, as well as the fun photos shot by party-goers in the photobooth, with automatic uploads thanks to Mifi. If you'd like a print of one of Jon's images, please contact him directly. A professional photo makes a great gift for the holidays.

Huge thanks to [Elizabeth Hodes Custom Cakes & Sugar Art](http://www.elizabethhodes.com/), who not only contributed the best looking cake we'd ever laid eyes on, it was delicious to boot! Thanks to [DJ iBeat](http://www.myspace.com/djibeat) & Will for spinning tunes and our excellent gang of volunteers who kept the party running smoothly. Thanks to Trader Joe's for providing delicious snacks, [Lucy’s Whey](http://www.lucyswhey.com/) for the excellent cheese trays, [Sustainable Party](http://www.sustyparty.com/) for eco-friendly supplies, and [Bulldog Gin](http://www.bulldoggin.com/) & [Brooklyn Brewery](http://www.brooklynbrewery.com/) for the great libations.


Finally, thanks to the great folks at Google's Community Affairs Team for contributing a fancy new Google Chromebook to the cause. Thanks to raffle sales, tickets & donations party-goers were able to contribute more than $2,000 to Dd's core mission to empowering marginalized communities, donations that are being doubled by generous donors.


We can't wait to see where we are a year from now!
