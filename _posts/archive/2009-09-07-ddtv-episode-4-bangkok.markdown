Mark and Emily are headed to Thailand. While there they'll be working with our partners located around Burma's borders to implement our programs: Handheld Human Rights and Project Einstein. In this episode the voyage begins: from packing, to flying, their arrival in Bangkok, and ultimately navigating the city, we follow Mark and Emily half way around the world as they begin the journey of launching the programs that have developed out of nearly 2 years of research and project development.
