[Digital Democracy 2009-2010 Annual Report](http://www.scribd.com/doc/66812155/Digital-Democracy-2009-2010-Annual-Report)

With deep gratitude to our global community of supporters who have made this work possible, we are thrilled to launch our first annual report. Covering the period from November, 2008, when we incorporated under the auspices of the [Institute for Multi-Track Diplomacy](http://www.imtd.org/) until the end of 2010, when we filed for our own independent non-profit status, the report documents our work to empower marginalized communities around the globe, and the inspirational ways they are using technology to build their own futures. Special thanks to [Bill Hopkins Media](http://billhopkinsmedia.com/) for generously donating our New York office, [Drew Frist](http://www.drewfrist.com/) for the Dd logo, [Zago](http://zagollc.com/) who designed this Annual Report, our [team](http://digital-democracy.org/who-we-are/team/), our [funders](http://digital-democracy.org/who-we-are/supporters/), our [advisory board](http://digital-democracy.org/who-we-are/supporters/) and generous individuals like you.

Societies are stronger when more people participate and along with the report, we also have a new promotional video to go along with it and help spread this message. [Javier Saavedra](https://twitter.com/javisaav) is the editor with [Steve Benjamin]( www.steve-benjamin.com) doing the graphics. All the footage is from our past two years in the field, either taken by us or our partners. We hope you like it:



Sincerely,
Emily Jacobi & Mark Belinsky, co-founders
