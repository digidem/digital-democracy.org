Inoculation against certain tropical diseases is a routine precaution for traveling in Southeast Asia but even getting a handful of shots in the U.S. can quickly become very expensive. As the debate over healthcare reform rages in the United States, Mark and Emily discuss what's available, including, the single-payer option being explored by groups such as [Healthcare Now!](http://www.healthcare-now.org/) or online consultations through Brooklyn-based [Hello Health](http://hellohealth.com/).Â  When it came to getting the necessary shots he needed for travel, Mark asked, "Why not just get them in Thailand?" It is with this question that a 3rd option was presented: medical tourism. Can Mark expect the same quality of care overseas? Can he afford it? And if so, what does that say about our own healthcare system in America? Find out on this episode of DdTv!
