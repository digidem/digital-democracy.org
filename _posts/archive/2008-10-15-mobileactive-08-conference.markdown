[![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/2937641155_9ffaac3a1b.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/2937641155_9ffaac3a1b.jpg) We presented at the [MobileActive 08](http://mobileactive08.org/) Conference in Johannesburg, South Africa about the use of mobile phones by members of the Burmese democracy movement around Burma's borders. Our “mini-talk” covered issues having to do with cross-border movement strategies against Authoritarian Regimes.

Read what one blogger had to say about our [session](http://mobileactive08.org/node/940).

Videographer Rhoda Davids captured us in this short video, featured on the MobileActive website, during which we explained the points we raised in our “mini-talk” as well as our project in-brief. [Check us out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeRepqn4rNs&feature=user )!
