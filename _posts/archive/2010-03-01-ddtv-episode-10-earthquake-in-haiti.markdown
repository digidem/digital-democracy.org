In early January 2010 we partnered with Tufts University's [Center for Emerging Market Enterprises](http://fletcher.tufts.edu/ceme/) (CEME) to conduct research and a photography training with young adults in Haiti. Researchers Chrissy Martin and Joshua Haynes, using the [Project Einstein](http://digital-democracy.org/what-we-do/programs/#projecteinstein) curriculum, worked with young adults ages 18-24 to explore - through the use of digital photography - how these youth view money and finance in their society.

Several days after the completion of this training a devastating Earthquake shook the country. In this episode of DdTv, Chrissy discusses her experiences being in the Earthquake, witnessing first-hand the toll it took on the country and its people, and her reflections on the photo training that took place only 3 days prior. In addition, the [emergency response](http://digital-democracy.org/2010/01/17/support-ongoing-haiti-earthquake-response-efforts/) through the use of [Ushahidi](http://haiti.ushahidi.com/), spearheaded by Chrissy and Josh's classmates at the Fletcher School and our Co-Directors Mark and Emily, which helped get critical updates including information about missing persons, locations of danger zones and available aid to groups working on the ground.
