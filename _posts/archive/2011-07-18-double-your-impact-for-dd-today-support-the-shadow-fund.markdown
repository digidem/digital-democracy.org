The Shadow Fund keeps Digital Democracy moving forward: designing new programs, building relationships with the right community partners and honing our curriculum and process to continue working with the _most _marginalized communities around the globe, to break them out of the shadows and allow them to drive the future of their societies and our world.


Supporters of the Shadow Fund believe marginalized groups must have a voice to build a better and more prosperous world for all. You can join the Fund today by donating and help Dd spearhead new work, collaborate with new partners and redefine the potential for digital tools around the globe.

**July 2011** jump-starts the Fund. Two anonymous donors have committed to match up to $6,500 raised by Dd by August 1. With your help, we can raise $13,000 in July to ensure Dd's work continues. Today is the last day to raise $2,535. Please [donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=9936590) today to help us reach our goal!** [Note: we have met and passed our goal. Thank you!!]**


The Shadow Fund sustains our work and ability to be at the cutting-edge of human rights & tech. Immediately, we aim to raise $13,000 this month and grow that seed to a total of $50,000 in the Fund by the end of 2011. We will keep growing from there!

Digital Democracy is supported by three kinds of funding: foundations, individuals and work we do with other development or non-profit organizations. Foundations have provided vital support for our programs and travel. Individual donations, though, are what truly make Dd possible. You and donors like you make our work with communities around the world possible.


[Please give today](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=9936590) to help make this launch a success & then stay tuned for more information...Thank you!
