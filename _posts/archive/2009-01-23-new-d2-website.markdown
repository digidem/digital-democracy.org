Welcome to our new site! We've made a lot of improvements in layout and design, and added some images that give you a more visual idea of what we're all about. It's easier to search archives of past entries on the right side of this page, and on the top of this page you can navigate through the options to locate more information about our programs, products, and how to donate.

We're always brainstorming ways to make our site even better, both great to look at and read, as well as user-friendly. If you have any design or Wordpress experience (or anyone you know does) and are interested in contributing your time and skills to D2, please let us know! Email us (info@dtwo.org) your information as well as links to work you've done. Be part of this exciting startup!
