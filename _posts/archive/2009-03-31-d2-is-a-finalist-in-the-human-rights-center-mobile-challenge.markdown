NetSquared just announced [the top 10 finalists](http://www.netsquared.org/hrc-ucb/topten) - including our project, [Handheld Human Rights](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/handheld-human-rights). We couldn't have made it this far without your support, votes and comments.

Congratulations to [Freedom Fone](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/freedom-fone), [Guardian](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/guardian-secure-private-anonymous-telephone-built-google-android), and others for also making it to the finals. The top 10 projects are strong, so D2 is in good company. We will be presenting our project along with the other finalists at [The Soul of the New Machine: ](http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/newmachineconference/)Human Rights, Technology, and New Media Conferenceat UC Berkeley in May. After the presentations, a panel of judges will pick three winners.
