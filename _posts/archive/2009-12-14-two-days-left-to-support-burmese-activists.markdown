Thanks to 46 backers, we've raised 75% of the money we need to translate Cory Doctorow's [Little Brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/about/) into four Burmese languages. It's been amazing to see such support.


But we only have until Dec. 15th at 8pm EST to raise the rest of the amount. Can you chip in and pledge? If we don't reach our goal, none of the project gets funded.

Special thanks to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, the Editor of Little Brother who [posted a blog entry about the project](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/011973.html). There have been lively comments, including this one from AndrDrew:


> "Wow! I'll be passing the word along about this  project. I'm now wondering what other works would be good candidates.

It's sad that Amazon's rules mean non-americans can't initiate Kickstarter projects. This is one amazing, and potentially game-changing way of fundraising."
