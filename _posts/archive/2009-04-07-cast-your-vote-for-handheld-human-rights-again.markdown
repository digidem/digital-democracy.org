([Read more in our previous blog post](http://www.dtwo.org/2009/03/31/d2-is-a-finalist-in-the-human-rights-center-mobile-challenge/).)

This week we've entered Handheld Human Rights in another NetSquared challenge. This time it's the [N2Y4 Mobile Challenge](http://www.netsquared.org/n2y4) which also seeks projects that leverage mobile technology for social change.  Like last week's challenge we need votes to advance into the next round to compete for cash prizes to make HHR possible.  This time there are 70 great projects in the competition and only the top 14 will be invited to the N2Y4 Conference from May 24-25.

Voting lasts until Friday, April 10.

If you voted for us last week the process is very simple.  [Login](https://www.netsquared.org/user?destination=node/57858) to NetSquared and go to the [N2Y4 Project Gallery](http://www.netsquared.org/projectgallery/n2y4) to vote for Digital Democracy's Handheld Human Rights. You must vote for 3-5 projects in order to cast your ballot.

If you didn't vote last time, simply [register](https://www.netsquared.org/user/register?destination=node/57858) and then you can cast your ballot.
