[![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mobile-phone1-200x300.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mobile-phone1.jpg)Voting just began for [UC Berkeley's Human Rights Center](http://hrc.berkeley.edu/) [Mobile Challenge](http://www.netsquared.org/hrc-ucb). There's an impressive gallery of projects and we are excited to have our proposal for [Handheld Human Rights](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/handheld-human-rights) among them.

There are approximately 50 projects in the gallery, and the 10 projects that receive the most votes between now and Friday, March 27 will be invited to the [Soul of the New Machine](http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/NewMachineConference/index.html): A conference on technology, new media and human rights at Berkeley in early May. After the projects are presented, a panel of judges will award prizes to the top three entries.

**How to participate:**
