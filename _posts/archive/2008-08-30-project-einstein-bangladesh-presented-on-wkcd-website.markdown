Project Einstein, Digital Democracy’s project which centers around photography service learning projects in youth communities, was first completed in Bangladesh, where we were able to work with Rohingya refugee children from Burma who are living in camps along the Bangladesh-Burma border. This project was supported by a Providence-based organization called What Kids Can Do (WKCD).

Using the Internet, print, and broadcast media, WKCD presses before the broadest audience a dual message: the power of what young people can accomplish when given the opportunities and support they need and what they can contribute when we take their voices and ideas seriously. The youth who concern WKCD most are those marginalized by poverty, race, and language.

While in Bangladesh, we were able to take with us, not only the wonderful photographs taken by the participants, but also their incredible thoughts and personal stories. The presentation of this work has been posted on the front page of the What Kids Can Do [website](http://www.whatkidscando.org). We have been thrilled to work with WKCD and are proud to have the audio slideshows from Project Einstein featured on their site.
