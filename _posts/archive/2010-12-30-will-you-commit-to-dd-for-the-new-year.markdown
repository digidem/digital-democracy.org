In September Digital Democracy made a [commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative](http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/ourmeetings/2010/) to use technology to empower women and girls fighting  gender-based violence in Haiti. This is part of our larger commitment to  engage with our local partners using technology to solve urgent problems in their communities.

This year our [dedicated team](../who-we-are/team/) harnessed  digital maps, mobile phones, blogs, cameras, and open-source software  to train over 400 people in the use of these tools to address local  challenges including:



	
  * University students using Ushahidi to respond to earthquakes in **Haiti** & **Chile**

	
  * Middle & High school students learning digital literacy in **Indiana**, **Kazahkstan **& **New York City**

	
  * Media producers in **Thailand** working to inform citizens despite censorship

	
  * Government officials in **Iraq** building tools for better democratic engagement

	
  * Young people mapping local peace efforts in advance of **Kenya**'s 2012 elections

	
  * Indigenous youth in **Guatemala** documenting their lives in the Zona Reyna

	
  * Librarians in **Ukraine** and **Romania** learning new tools to connect with users

	
  * Exiled Tibetans in **India** working for human rights in their homeland

	
  * Women activists fighting gender-based violence in **Haiti **


We  accomplished all of this on volunteer salaries, strategic grants and  your generous support. Next, we're forming a Board of Directors &  fortifying our core tools, methods, curriculum & partnerships.
