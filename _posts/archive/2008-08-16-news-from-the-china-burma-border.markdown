Today we wrapped up a several-day trip to the Chinese city of Ruili on the Burma border.  We conducted interviews and photography training sessions with youth from neighboring Kachin State as part of our continuing research efforts around Burma's borders. We were able to get a solid base from those we were speaking with about life on both sides of the border, and information about access to technology, which continues to be an extremely vital aspect of our research. With this trip we can now add valuable information from this border to our extensive research from Burma's other borders, including Thailand, India and Bangladesh - giving us the ability to give a geographically comprehensive view of community organizations and technology in the Burmese diaspora.

Thank you to everyone who made this trip, and our photography training sessions a success!"
