![momentum T](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/momentum-T2-201x300.png)Recently Gabe represented Digital Democracy at the [Tides](http://www.tides.org/about-us/index.html) [Momentum Conference](http://www.momentumconference.org/index.php) in San Francisco, a convergence of leaders, philanthropists and activists working on a wide range of progressive social issues. It was an opportunity to get together with other dedicated, hard-working folks to discuss problems, share stories and brainstorm solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing our society and our planet.

In addition to networking, Momentum featured fantastic speakers and panels. Speakers like  [John Kao](http://fora.tv/2009/09/09/MOMENTUM_John_Kao_on_the_New_Geography_of_Innovation) who talked about where global innovation is happening and [Sony Kapoor](http://fora.tv/2009/09/08/CAPITAL_Sony_Kapoor_on_Changing_a_System_of_Our_Creation) who gave a revelatory (and at times chilling) description of his past life in the financial industry. [Video](http://fora.tv/partner/Momentum) of all the speakers is available at Fora.tv.

Many thanks to Tides and all of the participants for making Momentum an exciting and fascinating event.
