Today, we're celebrating our second anniversary! It's hard to believe just how much we have worked on and accomplished over the past two years. And we're grateful for our community of supporters who have made all of this possible.

In reflecting over the past year, we've compiled some of the numbers from outputs from our programs and partnerships. As you read about them below, will you consider making a birthday gift donation to Digital Democracy in honor of our 2nd anniversary? A donation of any amount, whether $20, $200 or $2,000 will go to support our core programming for our third year. Donations can be made through our fiscal sponsor, [IMTD online](https://www.networkforgood.org/donation/ExpressDonation.aspx?ORGID2=52-1780842&vlrStratCode=CUlaExKG4btFXDlc4D%2bY29oenvHUyfDy21Z732h%2bDN2GNxThv8RiTqc009%2b9nLe4) or via [Facebook Causes](http://www.causes.com/causes/403921-digital-democracy?m=8af10cb0).
