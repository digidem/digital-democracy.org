This past week completed a long month of proposal-writing for us. When we're writing, it's hard not to get wrapped up in a single proposal, or the smaller themes that run throughout each one. After we've completed one, we like to get an overview of our work, to see what is and isn't being emphasized as we describe our organization and the more specific details of our various projects. By looking at the bigger picture, we can see the changing themes in our writing, and what could be altered or kept the same when we tackle our next one. To do this, we create [word clouds](http://www.wordle.net/) from our proposals. The cloud is created from the most frequently used words in the document. In addition, the words within the cloud vary in size depending on frequency of usage. The most interesting comparison can often be looking at word clouds from several different proposals side by side. See below for a few examples of word clouds created from 2 of our most recent proposals.
