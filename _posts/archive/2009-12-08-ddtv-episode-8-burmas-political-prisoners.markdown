The number of political prisoners has increased exponentially since Burma's Saffron Revolution in 2007. This number, as told by the [Assistance Association for Political Prisoners](http://www.aappb.org/)' Aung Myo Thein, is a clear indicator of the political situation in Burma.

In this episode of DdTv, Mark and Emily travel to northern Thailand to launch [Handheld Human Rights](../programming/#hhr). While there, they meet with Aung Myo Thein, a former political prisoner, now working along the Thai-Burma border to help prisoners like he once was. He gives them a tour of a museum in the organization, and we hear about the horrible conditions and treatment he experienced during his 6 1/2 years in one of Burma's most notorious prisons.
