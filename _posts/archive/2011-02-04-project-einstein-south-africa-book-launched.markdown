13 Kids + 4 Cameras = Project Einstein South Africa

We're proud to announce the launch of our brand new book created by the Project Einstein South Africa youth. It's designed by Smitha Alampur who is currently in South Africa delivering the books to the children and with writing help from our intern Ellen Knuti.

Project Einstein South Africa tells the story of thirteen young people who live in two shelters in Pretoria, South Africa. Over the course of five days, they learned how to take pictures with digital cameras and edit the images on computers. They chose the themes of Happiness, Peace, History and Culture to explore through photographs and audio interviews.

Read the book below and/or [order a copy](http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/1889164) for delivery. We're looking for schools elsewhere in the world to pair them with through our digital pen pal program so let us know if you have any leads. Thanks!
