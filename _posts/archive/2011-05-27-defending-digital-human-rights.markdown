This week, the G8 met in in France to discuss policies that will shape the future of the internet. While it's interesting to see this on the agenda,  it's a crucial time to reiterate the principles agreed to upon all nations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).

Digital Democracy believes in the importance of defending the principles of the UDHR in the 21st century by defining the specifics of what the right to free expression means. The deterioration of this right is proving to be the cornerstone for the deterioration of all rights.

Because of this, we are honored to be co-signers of the following letter that outlines principles engendered in [Article 19 of the UDHR](http://www.udhr.org/UDHR/ART19.HTM): that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and encourage other groups and individuals who believe in liberty on and off the web to do the same:
"We believe that G8 Member States should use the e-G8 meeting as an opportunity to publicly commit to expanding internet access for all, combating digital censorship and surveillance, limiting online intermediary liability, and upholding principles of net neutrality."

We're glad to see detailed principles emerging and encourage governments, corporations and citizens everywhere to adhere to them for the betterment and prosperity of all mankind.  The UDHR was agreed upon by all nations more than half a century ago and it's exciting to help define what those principles mean in the 21st century. We will continue to work closely with our grassroots partners who are driving for change thanks  in part to the principles engendered within it.

If you'd like to uphold [these principles](http://internetrightsandprinciples.org/node/397), please [sign on to this letter](https://www.accessnow.org/page/s/G8-Protect-the-Net).
