In November 2008, I traveled to Harare, Zimbabwe with Emily to investigate how technology is being used to overcome the obstacles that are inherent in a closed society. We researched methods of survival despite hyperinflation and looked at how communications strategies help citizens to address their needs.

It was fascinating to be there at a time when the economy made us trillionaires. We found that despite the hardships, including a cholera outbreak, people were still using technology as a means of figuring out new ways to relate to one another. To read about our research and findings, please view and download our report below.

Thanks to the [Arca Foundation](http://arcafoundation.org/) and our individual donors who helped make the trip possible, and to all those on the ground who helped us during our travels, who aren't mentioned here for their safety.
