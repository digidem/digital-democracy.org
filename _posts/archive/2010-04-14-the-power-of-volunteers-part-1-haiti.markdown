The power of new technologies has made a lot of headlines recently,  but behind these new tools is a deeper story - the power of the people  who wield [![image](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2762/4379912183_d0b1826786.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitaldemocracy/4379912183/)them. When it comes to open-source and particularly  crowd-sourcing tools, those people are so often volunteers, and they are  the true heroes of technological successes.

For me personally, the year 2010 has been quite emotional. The  tragedy of the earthquake in Haiti has been juxtaposed by the outpouring  of human support in response, and we've witnessed first-hand how  technology can help ordinary people contribute to the emergency  response. The folks at [Crisis Commons](http://crisiscommons.org/) have organized dozens  of crisis camps where volunteers contributed to earthquake  response, supporting tech tools, building apps and more. Thousands of volunteers [contributed](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2010/02/a-map-of-thousands.html) to the [OpenStreetMap  of Port-au-Prince,](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti) and [hundreds  of Haitian-Americans helped translate text messages from Kreyol to  English](http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/01/22/the-nuts-and-bolts-behind-4636-in-haiti/) once a Haitian shortcode was established.

Mark and I went to Boston to wait for the safe arrival of the Fletcher students [working on Project Einstein: Haiti when the earthquake struck](http://digital-democracy.org/2010/03/01/project-einstein-haiti-report-the-earthquake/) and had the privilege of being in Boston for the launch of the  Fletcher Situation Room where we helped train some of the early  volunteers who went on to train so many more. Their work has taken Ushahidi to a whole new level, creating new systems of organizing and verifying information. Their energy, devotion and  level of coordination has been truly inspiring.Â  Volunteers from the  Fletcher Ushahidi Situation Room have not only mapped over 3,500  incidents, they helped directly coordinate aid and save lives during  search and rescue missions.

Most importantly, many of the volunteers around the world who used technology tools to support earthquake relief have done so in an attempt to respect local voices and needs a much as possible. As the Ushahidi-Haiti team [works to hand over the platform to local actors](http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/03/22/ushahidi-haiti-connecting/), we are inspired by this new approach that demonstrates the power of putting technology in the hands of local actors. It's an exciting example of global community to take these successes and apply the lessons as a curriculum for other contexts around the world.
