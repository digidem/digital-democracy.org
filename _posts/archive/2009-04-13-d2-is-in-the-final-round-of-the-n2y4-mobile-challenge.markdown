[![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/n2y4_gr.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/n2y4_gr.jpg)Many thanks to everyone who voted for us last week in the [N2Y4 Mobile Challenge](http://www.netsquared.org/n2y4). Your votes got our project Handheld Human Rights into the second round of the challenge and have won us a spot in the [N2Y4 Conference](http://www.netsquared.org/conference/n2y4) in San Jose, CA from May 26-27. We couldn't have done it without your support and input!

Now we have the difficult task of facing the [other 14 finalists](http://www.netsquared.org/blog/amy-sample-ward/n2y4-mobile-challenge-15-featured-projects-announced) at the conference where a panel of judges will select three projects to receive cash prizes and in-kind technical support. Between UC Berkeley's Human Rights Center [Soul of the New Machine](http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/newmachineconference/) and the N2Y4 Conference we will be having a busy and productive May. Stay tuned for more updates on our progress.
