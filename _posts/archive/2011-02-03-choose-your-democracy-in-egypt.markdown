Right now there are protests throughout the middle east and governments are falling. People on the ground are calling for democracy and the world is wondering what they mean when they say it. What if we put up a fun interactive tool that helps to explain this? By translating the key terms associated with governance into Arabic and having people quickly click on the one that they associate more with democracy, we'll start to be able to gain a sense of what people are in the streets fighting for.

We call it "Choose Your Democracy"
