Last Thursday November 6 we presented our research from the Thai-Burma border at The Women’s Commission in New York City. The presentation was a success, presenting to an audience of about 40 people, we were able to cover the issues within our report, as well as some of our additional findings from Burma’s other borders (India, Bangladesh, and China). In addition we showed a short film Under the Sun: Life on the Thai-Burma Border that we shot in Thailand at the same time the initial research for the report was being completed. The film provided visual context for the report, in addition to the photos from around the borders, which accompanied the slides displaying our findings, used during the presentation.

This Thursday November 13th, at 2pm (est) we will be presenting our findings in Washington D.C. at the [U.S. Institute of Peace][1]. Please contact us for additional information: info@dtwo.org
