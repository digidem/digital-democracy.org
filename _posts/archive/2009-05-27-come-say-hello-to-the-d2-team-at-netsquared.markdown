Howdy dear readers andmobile advocacy for human rightsfans. The D2 Team is currently at the NetSquared conference working, jamming and spreading the word about our cool project, [Handheld Human Rights](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/handheld-human-rights).

We're of course having a lot of fun, meeting cool people, [tweeting about what we do](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23n2y4+%23handheld%0A) and would love to meet you.  So...come on by and say hi to us!  Here's a pic so you know the friendly bunch to say hi to!

I'm serving as D2's [Project Champion](http://www.memeshift.com/2009/05/18/digital-democracys-handheld-human-rights/) to help get the word out about the project and brainstorm and excute ideas to promote our [project](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/handheld-human-rights).
