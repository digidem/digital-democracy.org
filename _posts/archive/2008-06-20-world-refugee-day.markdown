[![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/wrd-2-300x162.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/wrd-2.jpg)Today we celebrated World Refugee Day with some help from the local Indianapolis Burmese community, as well as local supporters of Burma and Digital Democracy.  We hosted an event at the [Harrison Center for the Arts](http://www.harrisoncenter.org) in Indianapolis with over 250 attendees.  Highlights included our presentation of our own work on Burma's borders, several refugee speakers from Burma and Darfur, a fashion show, Burmese food that was eaten within an hour, musical and spoken word performances and a slideshow of Project Einstein, a service learning photography project we conducted with children in a refugee camp in Bangladesh. Also, the Latino Youth Collective sent about a dozen teenagers who worked in teams to film the event, conducted interviews with attendees, including Emily.  This was put on in collaboration with [Provocate.org](http://Provocate.org), a group that connects events, information, and organizations in Indianapolis by exploring the intersection of art and politics and the global and the local.  Thanks to everyone who came out and helped make the event a huge success!
