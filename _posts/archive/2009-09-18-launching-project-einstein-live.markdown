Over the next few days Mark and Emily will be in Western Thailand working in a refugee camp to launch our program [Project Einstein](/programming/#einstein) with a partner school. They'll be teaching digital photography skills to a group of 17 students so that the students can participate in Project Einstein, our digital pen pal program connecting refugee youth around Burma's borders with resettled refugees and their classmates in the United States.

Throughout this launch we'll be streaming live from the camps to the internet. Thanks to generous sponsorship from [Nokia](http://nokia.com) & [WomWorld](http://www.womworld.com/nokia/), we'll be streaming through the use of Nokia N97's - enabling viewers to hear first hand from the students at the school.

Tune in! - Visit [our channel](http://qik.com/ddtv) on Qik to watch the live-stream or watch right here!Â  If you're on Twitter send the students questions to [@digidem](http://twitter.com/digidem), so that they can answer in one of the feeds.

**We'll be doing livefeeds at:**

**9:30 pm EST TONIGHT - September 17**

**9:30 am EST Friday - September 18**

**9:30 pm EST Friday - September 18**

**Don't worry if you don't catch the videos live. Watch them later on Qik or this very blog.
