[![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/pioneers2-300x138.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/pioneers2.jpg)This year marks the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's journey across the Atlantic, and in celebration the Dutch government is sponsoring a series of events and programs called [NY400](http://www.ny400.org/about.php), reflecting on four centuries of Dutch-American relations.

One of these programs, [Pioneers](http://www.pioneers.nu/), brings a group of 'movers and shakers' from New York and Amsterdam to engage in innovative conversations in both cities. D2's co-director Mark Belinsky is one of 20 New Yorkers invited to the Pioneers program, and he's in great company. He and a fellow Pioneer were interviewed for [a recent blog post](http://www.ny400.org/features_article.php?id=43) on the program:


> These ‘pioneers’ will celebrate common values of creativity, diversity and entrepeneurship in Amsterdam and New York and the [two cities’ shared history](http://www.ny400.org/shared_history.php) of urban greatness that began 400 years ago. ...

Mark Belinsky, co-director of Digital Democracy, an organisation that intends to connect people in repressed societies, is also looking forward to meet the best and the brightest of the Netherlands who are on the forefront of social entrepreneurship. ‘Interaction in itself is a goal; it is also the best way to gain new perspectives’, Mark explains.


The first Pioneers session will be held from April 1-3 in Amsterdam. Comment with recommendations for Mark - the Pioneers will be collaborating on a vision statement for the future of both cities.
