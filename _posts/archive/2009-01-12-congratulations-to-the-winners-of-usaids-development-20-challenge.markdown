Thanks to everyone who voted for us for the [2008 Development 2.0 Challenge](http://www.netsquared.org/usaid)! We're grateful for your continued support. Unfortunately we did not make it to the 2nd round, but we send our congratulations to the winner, [Child Malnutrition Surveillance and Famine Response](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/child-malnutrition-surveillance-and-famine-response), and runners-up [ClickDiagnostics](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/clickdiagnostics-global-health) and [Ushahidi V2](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/ushahidi-v2-global-crisis-tool). We're excited to see how the field of mobile projects continues to develop in the coming year.
