Our community of supporters has always been one of Digital Democracy's greatest assets. From our fundraising campaign last Winter to our NetSquared campaigns this Spring, our supporters have always been there to lift us and up and help us move forward. And today we are reaching out to you again.

We have entered Project Einstein in the 3Banana [Share to Win](http://3banana.com/corp/share-to-win/) contest and we need you, our supporters, to help us win.

[![Click here to go to our Project Einstein note on 3Banana](http://static.3banana.com/pics/sharetowin_badge_290x90.png)](http://3banana.com/m/zWu/B33Rbbl880h)

The contest is very simple: we created a [note](http://3banana.com/m/zWu/B33Rbbl880h) about Project Einstein on the 3Bananas website. All you have to do is go to the [note](http://3banana.com/m/zWu/B33Rbbl880h) and leave a comment. The project note with the most comments will win the contest. First prize is $5000!

You have to create an account with 3Banana to leave a comment but it's very easy to set up. To make it even easier, if you have a Google account (and come on, who doesn't these days?) you can simply use that to login and leave a comment.

That's not all you can do. The contest is called Share to Win, so, share it! Tell your friends and contacts about the contest and forward them the link via e-mail, Facebook and Twitter. Just a few minutes of your time could equal great support for the young people participating in Project Einstein. Your support will have lasting impact.
