Introduction 029-2010, seeking to establish open data  standards for all city agencies.  Int. 029-2010 (formerly Intro.  991-2009) aims to increase government transparency and facilitate easier  access to public data.

Beyond the ‘good government’  benefits of this legislation, the bill will also unlock City data to  enable web developers and entrepreneurs to interact with City government  in new and unforeseen ways.  Data published under this legislation will  be readable by any computer device, including laptops and phones, for  innovative developments.  This Gov 2.0 inspired transparency legislation  targets application developers, startups, small businesses, and  academics with the ultimate goal of strengthening the connection between  government and the public, while re-energizing the small business-tech  sectors  and highlighting New York’s digital future.
