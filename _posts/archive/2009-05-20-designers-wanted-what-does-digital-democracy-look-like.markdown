[![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/design-300x158.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digidem-www/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/design.jpg)D2 is holding a 5 Day Design Sprint to come up with a new logo for our organization - and we're asking for your designs and ideas! D2 needs a logo that expresses our mission to empower civic engagement through digital technologies. So we're asking you to put your digital skills to use.

Think you're up to the task? Check out our[ website](http://www.dtwo.org) and draw up your ideas for a logo that represents the essence of  Digital Democracy.

Choose your medium - post designs to Facebook, upload to Flickr, Tweet them, or email info(at)dtwo(dot)org. Just make sure to tag #digidem so that we see them! Get those to us by Sunday, May 24, and we'll debut the winner at the [N2Y4 conference](http://www.netsquared.org/conference/n2y4) on May 26 and even get you a secret prize.

Not a designer? Not to worry. You can support us by spreading word about Handheld Human Rights using the #handheld hash tag. Better with words? Email us your ideas on what Digital Democracy means to you. Then tweet, blog, or tell your friends about the project.
