For two years Digital Democracy has built programs and worked with people around the world to empower groups whose voices are silenced. We train them to use innovative technologies to serve the needs they tell us they have.

Our partners — including refugee communities, government officials in Iraq, women living in tents in Haiti, middle school students in Indiana, Burma, and Kazakhstan—inspire us. We see the change in how they perceive their potential after trainings and while using new tech. We believe in the positive change they embody and the possibilities for people, democracy, technology, and freedom.

That’s why we started [#stuckonDd](http://digital-democracy.org/stuckondd/), a campaign that brings all of our partners and supporters around the world together and show your support to the world. Where does your Dd sticker live? On your computer, phone, bike, bed, or …? Show us!

Don’t have a sticker? It’s as easy as a **$10 donation** that goes straight to the heart of the matter: supporting Dd at our core. We are volunteers. We are operating with small strategic grants. We are bootstrapping and getting our space generously donated. We need your help to take Dd and all it can be into our third year.

[Please donate now](https://www.networkforgood.org/donation/ExpressDonation.aspx?ORGID2=52-1780842&vlrStratCode=MSiLdAT54itjdpdIo0PWW%2fRAzctglM7qxFtURa6EbtvKGM29BjKSO%2bcuFyVHrSMY), get a sticker, [share with the community](http://stuckondd.posterous.com/), and TWEET IT UP. We can’t wait to see where you’re #stuckonDd.

Get creative…
And if you’re in New York, join us for some sticky fun at our [2nd Birthday Party](http://digidemparty.eventbrite.com/) on December 20 at New Work City!
