Working on a photography project with kids in Bangladesh, as their work drew to a close, the Anyat Ullah chose a name for the  project “Project Einstein.” All the kids quickly agreed, explaining:


> “Einstein was a refugee,  but he could still do great things.”


Since those humble beginnings, our digital literacy program has grown to now be in [Bangladesh](http://bit.ly/cNqcWK), [Thailand](http://bit.ly/9BPJCh), [Haiti](http://bit.ly/abdGJC), [Kenya](http://bit.ly/dppg5U), [South Africa](http://bit.ly/aAqQ7K), [Guatemala](http://bit.ly/ba07gc), [Kazakhstan](/archive/tech-teens-in-kazakhstan/), and in the USA to [Indiana ](/archive/launching-project-einstein-indy-with-support-from-the-clowes-fund/)and [New York City](http://digital-democracy.org/2010/06/07/future-now-nyc%E2%80%99s-digital-storybook/).

I'm excited to now offer [our curriculum free for download](http://digital-democracy.org/what-we-do/materials/project-einstein-training-manual/). Working with [IREX International](http://www.irex.org/) on the Kazakhstan project, we were even able to have it translated into [Russian](http://digital-democracy.org/what-we-do/materials/project-einstein-training-manual/) and [Kazakh](http://digital-democracy.org/what-we-do/materials/project-einstein-training-manual/) languages. I hope that you find this helpful and please let me know if there's anything you'd like to see in future issues so that we can incorporate it. As always, it's Creative Commons license, so feel free to share and add to it yourself also! Just let us know so we can follow the awesome.
