Our work with Haiti helped bring together a coalition of twelve  U.S. Senators to take up the issue of sexual and gender based violence  in Haiti and ask that funding be earmarked for the protection of Haitian  women and girls. Thank you to Senators Mike Johanns (R-NE), Frank  Lautenberg (D-NJ), Sam Brownback(R-KS), Tim Johnson (D-SD), Richard  Durbin (D-IL), Olympia  Snowe (R-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Charles Schumer (D-NY), George  Voinovich (R-OH), Benjamin Cardin (D-MD), Robert Casey, Jr. (D-PA), and  Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) for advocating on behalf of Haitian women.

Our   coalition is working to ensure that the there continues to be a leading  force in pushing for the security and inclusion of Haitian women in  recovery processes, especially those still occupying some 1400 camps in  and around Port Au Prince.
