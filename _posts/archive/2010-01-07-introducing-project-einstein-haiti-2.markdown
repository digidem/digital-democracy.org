The year is certainly off to an exciting start. Digital Democracy is putting together our annual report for 2009 and pushing out new projects for 2010. We're excited to announce **Project Einstein: Haiti**

Dd is partners with a research team  from The Fletcher School at Tufts University supported by the Center for Emerging Market Enterprises ([CEME](http://fletcher.tufts.edu/ibc/ceme.shtml)) and the [Mastercard Foundation](http://www.themastercardfoundation.org/). Two students, Chrissy Martin & Joshua Haynes, are using Digital Democracy's Project Einstein curriculum & equipment to work with local youth to have them investigate the economic lives of those around them through photography.

Stay tuned for fascinating photos from the youth.

Project Einstein: Haiti developed following the  "Savings and Chance" scoping study conducted by Kim Wilson and team in July 2009.  The goal of that project was to comprehend the possibility of adapting the lottery (borlette) culture to promote savings, as banks around the world have been able to do this successfully. The team is investigating the current financial strategies of youth to better grasp the potential impact of lottery-linked savings programs on individuals’ longer-term financial sustainability.

Thank you to the Center for Emerging Market Enterprises ([CEME](http://fletcher.tufts.edu/ibc/ceme.shtml)) & [The Fletcher School at Tufts University](http://fletcher.tufts.edu/) for initiating this project and to the [Mastercard Foundation](http://www.themastercardfoundation.org/) in supporting their expenses. Support was provided to us by [WOMworld/Nokia](http://www.womworld.com/nokia/) for phones and video cameras.
