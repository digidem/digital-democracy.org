[![image](http://mudball.net/pcamp09/wp-content/themes/dfblog/images/logo.png)](http://mudball.net/pcamp09/)How do we make democracy more inclusive, more fair, and more fun? Participation Camp will provide the spark for an explosion of sharing, experimentation, and collaboration around this vital question.




Mark will lead a session on the OpenMyCity project.  The goal of OpenMyCity is to find the best ideas about how to make use of municipal open data by asking citizens and organizations to answer a simple fill-in-the-blank question: “If I knew ___, I could do ___.”




OpenMyCity is backed by a coalition that formed around the Pioneers conference that took place recently in New York and Amsterdam.  At PCamp, Mark will lead a workshop to build a plan for capturing as many stories as possible.  This effort provides a human component to the technological and legislative efforts already happening around municipal data.




Digital Democracy is proud to sponsor this conference. The conversations that will happen here are at the forefront of considering how to use new technology to stimulate civic participation in the United States and abroad.
