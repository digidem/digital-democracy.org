Co-organized by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative ([HHI](http://hhi.harvard.edu/programs-and-research/crisis-mapping-and-early-warning)) and John Carroll University ([JCU](http://www.jcu.edu/politicalscience/)), ICCM is bringing together leading thinkers and practitioners in the field of humanitarian work and human rights, along with scholars, software developers, policy makers and donors.

Co-organizer Patrick Meier of HHI, a member of Digital Democracy's [Advisory Board](http://www.digital-democracy.org/about/advisory-board/), was recently quoted in the Reuters article [Crisis mapping brings X-ray style clarity to humanitarian response](http://www.alertnet.org/db/an_art/57939/2009/09/12-144735-1.htm)_:


> "Crisis mapping is to the humanitarian space what x-rays are to public health. It helps us to understand at a micro level the behaviour we see in humanitarian emergencies."


We are looking forward to sharing our own work on crisis mapping in Burma and around its borders, including our recent work in Thailand on Handheld Human Rights ([HHR](http://www.digital-democracy.org/programming/#hhr)), and learning from the work of fellow attendees.

The goal of ICCM 2009 is to formalize the field of crisis mapping, and we are honored to participate in conversations that will help shape the future of the field. The TED-style conference will include Ignite Talks, Tech Fair demo's, Birds-of-a-feather sessions and Open roundtables. Digital Democracy will be representing HHR in the Tech Fair, as well as covering the event for [DdTv](http://www.digital-democracy.org/ddtv/). Watch our [Twitter stream](http://twitter.com/digidem) and [ICCM 2009](http://twitter.com/crisismapping) for live footage of the conference.

ICCM 2009 is sponsored by the Open Society Institute ([OSI](http://www.soros.org/)), Humanity United ([HU](http://www.humanityunited.org/)) and the US Institute of Peace ([USIP](http://www.usip.org/)).
