We are thrilled to announce support from [United States Institute of Peace](http://www.usip.org/) for our work with grassroots Haitian Women's groups. Thanks to an urgent grant from their Haiti program, we are launching a citizen reporting initiative for the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections in Haiti, scheduled for November 28.

This week, I'm in Port-au-Prince to launch this initiative along with my colleagues Abby Goldberg & Emilie Reiser. Over the next few days we'll be training 50 Haitian women as well as meeting with key partners including the Haitian tech company Solutions, the [Bureau des Avocats Internationaux](http://ijdh.org/) and representatives of the UN & Government ministries. Although Abby and I are only here for the week,  Emilie will be staying on in Haiti to provide ongoing training and support through the elections.

The training will include a discussion of electoral rights, identifying barriers to civic participation in the upcoming election and training the women on how to use tools to report on the elections and electoral-related violence. The training on tech tools includes how to use the [Noula platform](http://www.noula.ht/), [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com/) and how to upload blog updates.

In addition to producing a report on this initiative and the findings of our citizen reporters over the course of the next month, this training will help us meet the first part of [our commitment to Clinton Global Initiative](http://http//digital-democracy.org/2010/09/20/commitment-to-clinton-global-a-visitor-from-haiti/), to empower Haitian women in the use of tools that will help them organize and respond to gender-based violence.

It is a challenging but important time for us to be doing this work. All of our Haitian partners are working to respond to the devastating news of [a cholera outbreak](http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MCOI-8AJM59?OpenDocument), and our coalition of partners including the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti and [Madre](http://www.madre.org/) have filed a [petition to the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights on Sexual Violence in Haiti's displaced persons camps](http://www.madre.org/index/press-room-4/news/human-rights-groups-file-legal-petition-on-sexual-violence-against-women-and-girls-in-camps-for-displaced-in-haiti-525.html). Amidst this very serious news, we're reminded of how great the stakes are for our Haitian partners, and the critical role of technology to help them address these problems.

As I write, two of our partner organizations have just finished a meeting with a song. It's also a reminder of the human capacity for joy and the need to connect with one another. We hope you'll follow along on our trip, through blogs, multi-media and micro-blogs - our twitter feeds: [Digidem](http://twitter.com/digidem), [Abby](http://twitter.com/DigiAbby), [Emilie](http://twitter.com/Emreiser) and [me](http://twitter.com/Emjacobi).
