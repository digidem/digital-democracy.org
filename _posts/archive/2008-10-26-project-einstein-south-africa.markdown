We’ve partnered with New Words, What Kids Can Do, and [Khulisa](http://www.khulisaservices.co.za) on a photography service learning project we’ve been doing in Johannesburg over the past several days. We’re looking to leverage this project into a digital exchange using internet technology via Digital Democracy’s project Virtual Community Center (VCC). The aim of this digital exchange using our platform is getting the voice of these children out in their community. Check out some of our pictures that include the talented kids we’ve been working with!


This time around, they chose a different set of topics:




Cheese Boys - Peace




Cool Girls - Culture




Fine Team Super Boys - History




Girlfriends - Happy People
