In this episode of DdTv venture back with us to January 2008 to see the origins of [Project Einstein](http://digital-democracy.org/what-we-do/programs/#projecteinstein). Mark and Emily spend several days working with youth in Kutupalong refugee camp in Southern Bangladesh, home to thousands of [Rohingya](http://digital-democracy.org/2009/02/06/january-2009-press-release/) refugees from Burma. Stateless, the Rohingya, a muslim ethnic group from Western Burma have fled to Bangladesh to escape the human rights violations they've suffered in Burma, where they are also denied citizenship.

In the camp, Mark and Emily train a group of youth ages 9-14 in digital photography skills, enabling the kids to explore where in their lives they encounter such universal themes as peace, happiness, the disabled and sadness. See their photographs, listen to them as they reveal their dreams, their hopes for the future, and become the inspiration behind the creation of Project Einstein.
