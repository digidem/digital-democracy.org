The [Sunburnt Cow](http://www.thesunburntcow.com/) provided the perfect atmosphere, allowing for great interactions and conversations. Most importantly we met our goal for the night: To get out the vote for our [Handheld Human Rights](http://www.netsquared.org/projects/handheld-human-rights) project. We appreciate everyone taking the time to cast their ballots!

Voting for the [Human Right Center Mobile Challenge](http://www.netsquared.org/hrc-ucb) is open through Friday, March 27 at 6pm EDT. So if you couldn't make it last night, you can still help us out by taking the time to [login and vote](http://netsquared.org/hrc-ucb/vote)!

See our [previous post](http://www.dtwo.org/2009/03/23/vote-for-us-in-the-human-rights-center-mobile-challenge/) for more details.
