Bangkok is one of the centers of tech innovation in Asia, but it hasn't always been that way. Tune in as our newly inoculated team moves from Bangkok Hospital to speak with [John Berns](http://www.johnberns.com), one of the co-founders of [Barcamp Bangkok](http://www.barcampbangkok.org/ ), about the rise of the local tech community. After a bike tour of the city, Emily and Mark travel to [Open Dream]( http://opendream.co.th/) to meet Thai developers building digital tools for civil society and business. They give us a tour of their office co-working space. What do open government initiatives look like in Thailand and are there ways to support the community there by creating programming teams for new gadgets things like [Livescribe](http://www.livescribe.com)? Find out in this episode of DdTv!
