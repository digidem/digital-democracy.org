Thank you to everyone who came out to [celebrate with Digital Democracy](http://digidem.eventbrite.com/) as weÂ  turned one year old.

Over 200 people came to eat, drink, and be merry at the Open Planning Project's gorgeous penthouse & rooftop in Soho, NYC for a party highlighting young change-makers in NYC. Even more tuned in to watch LIVE as we streamed interviews with people, asking them how they are changing the world. Filmed on our new Nokia n97s, by interviewers [Michael Morgenstern](http://mjmfilms.com) & [Dan Latorre](http://tint.org/), you can [check out 20+ short answers](http://qik.com/ddtv), or contribute your own below. Others still added to our Twitfall by tweeting in their own responses.
