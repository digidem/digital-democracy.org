Working in the tech sphere, it’s the power and passion that people  have that never ceases to astound me. Following the Jan. 12 earthquake  in Haiti, people around the world contributed an incredible outpouring  of support for the people of Haiti. Now, as that support expands to  Chile, it is evident that we are participating in a game changing  moment.

On January 12th when the earthquake in Haiti struck, [Digital Democracy](../) had two team members on the ground looking at the [ economic livlihoods of young Haitians ](../2010/03/01/project-einstein-haiti-report-the-earthquake/) . Worried for their safety and the greater loss of life, [my colleague](http://twitter.com/emjacobi) Emily [and I](http://twitter.com/mbelinsky) immediately joined Patrick in the Situation Room at Fletcher, and  collaborated with the core team to establish a system that allowed  hundreds of volunteers to glean emergency instances from the ground and  place them [on the map](http://haiti.ushahidi.com/) for response. Those first volunteers have trained many more, and their tireless work has directly saved lives.

When an 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile on Saturday, we were  called on again to train volunteers. The Fletcher Ushahidi team, their  hands full with Haiti, was able to rapidly set up the site for [Chile.Ushahidi.com](http://chile.ushahidi.com/),  but needed help training new volunteers. Digital Democracy collaborated  to adapt the training module for the Situation Room at the Fletcher  School at Tufts University, and on Sunday night we conducted an hour+  training on Skype for a core team at [SIPA at Columbia ](http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/)in  New York City who are now running the Chile operations. Their ability  to quickly respond to the devastating emergency in Chile, despite it  being midterms week, speaks to the dedication and passion of the  volunteers. The 10 people we trained on Sunday trained 40 more the next  day at SIPA, plus a growing number of volunteers in Santiago.

For us, this has been a particularly rewarding process, as we’ve been  following and working with Ushahidi since fall 2008. Watching Ushahidi  evolve from mapping post-election violence in Kenya to elections  reporting when we helped with VoteReportIndia, we’ve worked to harness  Ushahidi to empower ordinary citizens. At Digital Democracy, we’ve  applied Ushahidi to map human rights abuses in Burma through [Handheld Human Rights](../handheldhumanrights) and peace mapping in Kenya through [Sisi Ni Amani – “We are Peace.”](http://sisiniamani.wordpress.com/) In each case, we’ve worked with local community organizations to  determine needs and apply the  technology – Ushahidi – to best meet  their needs.

Our mission is to utilize technology for civic engagement, and these  examples demonstrate how technology can encourage deeper engagement with  the world around us. At the core, it’s not the technology but the  people who use it. Ushahidi is a tool that’s a key part of our arsenal  because of the open community around it. As technology enables more and  more people to contribute to meaningful actions to save lives, I for one  am excited to see where it leads.
