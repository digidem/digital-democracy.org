Tomorrow morning [Abby and I travel to Port-au-Prince](http://digital-democracy.org/2010/04/19/traveling-to-haiti-to-support-local-women/) to focus on the needs of Haitian women. On our trip we have two objectives, and we need your help to meet them.



	
  1. Investigating how technology can be leveraged to protect women and girls from gender-based violence.

	
  2. Conducting media trainings with women and leaving them with equipment to continue reporting their views from the ground.


The second objective **is where you come in**. Our training equipment was destroyed in the earthquake, and we need to purchase more. We'd like to raise enough money to leave equipment with the training participants. The voices of Haitian women are key to the redevelopment process.

Our overall trip budget is $7,500, and thanks to individual donors and a travel grant from the [Arca Foundation](http://www.arcafoundation.org/), we have now raised $5,150. We need your support to raise the final $2,500 and purchase equipment to leave in the hands of Haitian women. Please donate to our fiscal sponsor IMTD today.
