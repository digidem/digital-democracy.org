This week, D2's Co-Directors Mark and Emily are attending the Fifth Annual United Nationsâ€™ [Web4Dev Conference](http://www.web4dev.org/index.php/Main_Page), hosted by UNICEF. Web4Dev has re-united them with many of the other participants they met while presenting at the [MobileActive 08](http://www.mobileactive08.org/) Conference in Johannesburg back in October including [InSTEDD](http://instedd.org/) and [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/). Thursday explored many themes including monitoring and evaluation, which included a presentation by InSTEDD's Robert Kirkpatrick exploring their projects which include, [GeoChat](http://instedd.org/geochat), [Mesh4X](http://instedd.org/index.php?q=mesh4x), and a new project, [Evolve](http://instedd.org/evolve).
