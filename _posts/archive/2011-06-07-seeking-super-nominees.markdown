NOW SEEKING: Curiosity, passion, experience. We are building our first Board of Directors and eager to hear who you think the best candidates are.

We also welcome nominations for new Advisors - experts excited to share their insights and advice to make Dd's programs as effective as possible. The first term of our current [Advisory Board](http://digital-democracy.org/who-we-are/advisors/) is ending and some advisory positions are now open.
