In October 2008, Mark and Emily did a digital storytelling photography project with youth living in shelters in Pretoria, South Africa. During the course of the five-day training the 13 young people learned how to use digital cameras and flip video, and how to critique and edit their own photos. They traveled throughout the city, and with these new skills, were able to capture the surroundings from their own point of view. During the training, the participants were interviewed about topics ranging from their daily trip to school, their hopes and dreams for the future, and the experience of growing up in South Africa after Apartheid.

We used these photos and personal thoughts and stories to create four audio slideshows. Two of the slideshows are currently being featured by [Telegraph 21](http://www.telegraph21.com/video/after-apartheid-hopes-dreams), a curated video magazine launched in mid-January 2010. One of our partners, Telegraph 21's focus is non-fiction storytelling, and highlights three new interactive features every week. You can view our slideshows on Telegraph 21 throughout this weekend, and via [What Kids Can Do](http://www.whatkidscando.org/featurestories/2009/08_south_africa/index.html), our partner for the project.
