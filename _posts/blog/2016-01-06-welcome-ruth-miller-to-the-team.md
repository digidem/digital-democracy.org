title: Welcome Ruth Miller to the Team
---

Digital Democracy is thrilled to start the new year with a new team member, Ruth Miller. Ruth is joining us for the spring to observe and advise on our operational and technical strategy. She'll join our Program Director in Peru and Guyana to meet some of our partners, and help us prepare to grow both our team and the impact of our work.

Ruth comes to Dd with a passion for community-led technology development. From map-making with at-risk agricultural communities to transportation advocacy in Oakland, Ruth has considerable experience working directly with communities advocating for their rights. Her recent work leading technology strategy at Aspiration and managing user interaction design and product development at BlinkTag round out her skills to make her the perfect fit to our small but growing team. Ruth is also an avid traveler, and we’re excited to have her join us on trips to the field to work directly with our local partners.
