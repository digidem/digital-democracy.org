title: Welcome Ruth Miller to the Team
---


Digital Democracy is thrilled to be starting the new year with a new staff member, Ruth Miller. Ruth is joining our team as Product Manager, and will be overseeing development of Dd’s tools and products as well as helping coordinate events, hackathons and other convenings. 

Ruth comes to Dd with a passion for community-led technology development. From map-making with at-risk agricultural communities to transportation advocacy in Oakland, Ruth has considerable experience working directly with communities advocating for their rights. Her recent work leading technology strategy at Aspiration and managing user interaction design and product development at BlinkTag round out her skills to make her the perfect fit to our small but growing team. Ruth is also an avid traveler, and we’re excited to have her join us on trips to the field to work directly with our local partners.
