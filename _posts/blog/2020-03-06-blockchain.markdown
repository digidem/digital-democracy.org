When building and deploying tech, we at Digital Democracy are rethinking the
status quo of technology development, starting with the data. In the Silicon
Valley model, user data is held hostage and sold on advertising marketplaces as
a speculative asset. Instead, we're building applications where information is
controlled by those who generate it. In [Mapeo](https://mapeo.world), data is
managed as a common resource, and those who generate data also govern that
data. Communities retain ownership of data, rather than corporations and
governments controlling access to it. We’re part of a larger movement that is
fighting the monopolization of digital knowledge by a few Silicon Valley
"cloud" companies. 

## Rethinking the status quo from the data up

In reality, a "cloud" is just a buzzword for data storage on someone else's
computer. When the data is held like this by a third-party, users are opened up
to threats to their autonomy and decision-making, such as censorship,
surveillance, and access restriction. For example, in Fall 2019, a change in
export law required that U.S. companies block users connecting from Syria,
Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba
([1](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/),
[2](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/adobe-to-ban-users-from-venezuela-due-to-us-executive-order/)).
Without warning, users were effectively cut off access to their data. This sets
a dangerous precedent, where knowledge can disappear or be inaccessible
permanently. This is a power dynamic that creates information security
vulnerabilities and is especially dangerous for marginalized people, frontline
communities, and social movements.

When we at Digital Democracy design and build technology alongside marginalized
people and frontline communities, we utilize a [set of principles called
local-first software](https://www.digital-democracy.org/blog/localfirst/) that
lock-in autonomy into the data and code. In this approach, data is
hosted on each user's device without requiring a cloud or centralized server,
and is synchronized between devices in a [peer-to-peer
network](https://dat.foundation/), similar to BitTorrent. Data then becomes a
common-pool resource, managed by those who generate the data, which cannot be
enclosed upon by the state or the market. Once knowledge is distributed in this
way, people are able to take cooperative ownership of the data they generate. 

**The entire business model of Silicon Valley breaks down without monopolistic
control of user data & interaction, and this is why this approach hasn’t been
pursued by many in the technology industry to date.**  However, in a
value-driven nonprofit like Digital Democracy, we’ve been able to prioritize
this peer-to-peer development model because it’s what works the best for our
partners. Unlike a company or government, we’re able to listen and respond to
concerns of marginalized groups that have no money or political clout. Our
mission is to co-design these applications alongside marginalized communities,
even if they request features that aren’t profitable. 

## What about Blockchain?

Blockchain often comes into the conversation at this point. It has proved to be
a clever mechanism that facilitates transactions (like money) across a web of
potentially untrusted computers. It also is a type of a distributed system and
uses some of the same computer science concepts as peer-to-peer applications.
Even the original Bitcoin paper has ['Peer to Peer' in the
title](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Blockchain takes peer-to-peer technology and adds an algorithm called "machine-facilitated
consensus," which can be relatively complex. This programmatic consensus
involves actors called "miners" who run computationally expensive
algorithms that earn money in exchange for computing power. These miners are
sometimes able to make profit over their electricity costs. This incentivizes
the purchase of ever larger and more expensive data centers, rewarding miners
who are able to take larger financial risks. This model at best excludes those
living in poverty, and at worst, extorts them. [What's been shown is that with
blockchain mining, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and those in the
middle take enormous risks that can go either
way.](https://www.investopedia.com/news/no-everyone-not-getting-rich-bitcoin/)
-- and that’s not even factoring in the [negative environmental
impacts.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191113092600.htm)

But why does a blockchain need this complex consensus algorithm? Because this
system is designed for a scenario where public transactions are mediated 
between participants which are all potentially malicious. 
These “trustless” transactions are the key assumption baked within blockchains
that distinguishes them from peer-to-peer applications. In contrast,
applications like Mapeo assume that data is managed by the community generating
it -- and some of that data may never be publicly accessible. This approach
creates a closed group, where data creators are also data stewards, managing
their own data and controlling who has access. Local-first applications like
Mapeo can make security and privacy guarantees that a public blockchain cannot.
We take security seriously and maintain protections from third-party attacks
such as targeted hacks and surveillance.  For users of Mapeo, privacy is
critical for protecting their ancestral knowledge and environmental monitoring
data until it’s ready to be shared with trusted partners such as legal and
advocacy groups. 

**Although blockchain authors claim it to be 'trustless' and horizontal and
autonomous, technology is not neutral, which in practice means that [you have
to trust someone at some
point.**](https://www.article19.org/resources/blockchain-technology-alone-cannot-protect-freedom-of-expression/).
Any technology requires its users to [trust the rules set by the software
engineers, designers, and
investors.](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sea2.12136)
Those able to understand and participate in these technical rulemakings
primarily represent existing power imbalances -- they are mainly [technical,
white, and male, and largely from the U.S. and
Europe.](https://fortunly.com/statistics/blockchain-statistics/#gref). So then,
is a "trustless" public blockchain that much of a departure from the
centralized power structures which we are trying to move away from? Who has the
incentive to participate and invest in a blockchain to set the rules? Who
benefits when a new market is created and who is enriched by that market? 

Blockchain simply isn’t the right tool for a privacy-first digital knowledge
commons. It isn’t the right tool for challenging the tech colonialist status
quo of Silicon Valley. To be clear, there may be some important uses for it,
but we have concluded it's not well-suited for protecting freedom of expression
and human rights, and therefore we do not advocate its use. If you want to
learn more, please read the recent [report by Article 19 which outlines this
position in more
detail](https://www.article19.org/resources/blockchain-technology-alone-cannot-protect-freedom-of-expression/).

## Digital Knowledge as a Commons

Mapeo is not blockchain-based, although there is overlap in some of the
underlying technology used. We'd rather pull from common-pool resource
management to describe our work in this area. In Elinor Ostrom’s book
[*Understanding Knowledge as a
Commons*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/understanding-knowledge-commons),
published in 2006, she laid the groundwork for not just natural resources as
commons, but also **digital knowledge**. In the last decade, we've seen a
growth of attention on digital knowledge commons, such as libraries, wikis,
open source code, maps, scientific articles, and everything in between. Digital
Democracy is putting this theory into practice by developing the tools and
doing the research to make that possible in an application near you.
