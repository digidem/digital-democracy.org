excerpt: What kind of world are we building with our maps? How many of us take
  the time to ask this when we sit down with our tools (whether pen & paper or
  state of the art software) to draw our polygons and lines? And yet to make a
  map — and publish it, or define a congressional district with it, or profile
  where protests for Black Lives Matter are happening — is an act that affects
  the world. With our maps, we can reify old biases, or we can open people’s
  hearts. We can further entrench corrupt power systems, or we can call for a
  more just future.
