This GIS day Digital Democracy is excited to announce a grant from the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation which will allow us to scale up our development of the Mapeo Platform, an offline open-source map creation suite for desktop and mobile. [Read](/assets/20171115-press-release.pdf/) our full press release.

The need for new software came from our partners – indigenous communities – who find that existing software is unsuitable due to its complexity, online dependence or top-down management. The people we work with wanted something that would enable the whole community, including non-literate members, to understand how the mapping was being done, a system which they could edit and manage and which would produce maps in line with their values and cultures.

Mapeo uses OpenStreetMap's easy-to-use iD Editor, which can be customized to create presets in any language, and symbology designed by the communities.

A test version of Mapeo desktop is available for download [here](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/). We are currently in the design phase for Mapeo Mobile, an app for mapping and monitoring that will allow groups to collaborate on collecting information about the world around them and share it with each other, or wider audiences.

> If you are interested in the technical workings of Mapeo, all our development is happening in the open [on GitHub](https://github.com/digidem/) where you can follow along and, if you have time and the skills, jump into the issues and help us fix some things.
