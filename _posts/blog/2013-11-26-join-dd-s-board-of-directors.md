## Seeking nominations for Dd's Board

A special message from Dd Board President Michael Gaouette:
Digital Democracy is on a great run. We are extremely proud of the work we have done in Haiti and Burma/Myanmar and very excited about what we have begun in Mexico, Peru and Guyana. What ties all this work together is a strongly held belief that marginalized communities must be supported as they assert their rights; and that tech has a role to play in that process, because tech and its effects belong to everyone. These are the fundamental principles that drive our organization.

After a period of sustained organic growth, we are expanding our board by two seats and have begun the search for candidates who embrace our fundamental principles and can join us in stewarding the organization as it continues to go from strength to strength. We invite you to share your nominations via the following form.
