In August I was priviledged to be invited to the [global indigenous mapping conference](http://www.rightsandresources.org/events.php?id=923) in Samosir, North Sumatra represent Digital Democracy. Indigenous peoples from around the world spoke passionately about their struggle to defend their ancestral lands from ever encroaching deforestation, contamination and colonization, and the importance of mapping and digital tools for supporting that struggle.

> "Mapping not only empowers indigenous communities with evidence that they can
> use to assert their land rights, it also provides communities with the ability

Read more about the conference in [this blog post](http://participatorygis.blogspot.nl/2013/08/at-global-land-rights-conference.html) by Giacomo Rambaldi from the [Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation](http://www.cta.int/en/), Philippines.

The participants highlighted the importance that the technology for mapping and monitoring is accessible to indigenous peoples and that the information is controlled by them.

Over the coming months we will be releasing new tools that we hope will make mapping, GIS and environmental monitoring more accessible to indigenous peoples in remote areas.
