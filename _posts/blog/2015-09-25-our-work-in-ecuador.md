I'm in Ecuador right now, I've just finished drone training with a group of community environmental monitors from a region of the Ecuadorian Amazon heavily affected by oil drilling over the past 4 decades. Today I am flying to the Waorani communities of Nemopare and Kiwaro to kick of a territory mapping project, helping the villages communicate their vision of their territory and their forest to the outside world through maps participatory video. <a class="play-link">Watch the video</a> to learn more about our work in Ecuador.
