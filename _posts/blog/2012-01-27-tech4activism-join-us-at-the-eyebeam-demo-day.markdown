"From Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, technology has played an important role in shaping contemporary resistance and the representation of these events in the media. What new tools of protest and occupation have emerged over the past year? How does their use help to shape tomorrow’s democracies?" — Eyebeam

We'll be joining 15 other [projects](http://demo-day.org/projects/  ) and organizations, presenting on how we've used tech to help activism.

Eyebeam is located at 540 W 21st St. New York, NY 10011 ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=540+W+21st+St.+New+York,+NY+10011&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x89c259c78e0175f5:0xaa890b32e9461f3d,540+W+21st+St,+New+York,+NY+10011&gl=us&ei=bBYjT7-cDYHv0gHE0pW4CA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CCEQ8gEwAA)).
