## Help us Hack the Rainforest

Calling all technologists, mobile app developers and passionate civic-techers: Digital Democracy is partnering with [Seamless Planet](http://seamlessplanet.com) to offer a one-of-kind opportunity to travel to the Peruvian Rainforest to collaborate with local indigenous activists who are working to document and respond to oil contamination and environmental threats in the Peruvian & Ecuadorian Amazon. 

Dd first worked with Seamless Planet - an adventure travel company devoted to supporting local people and cultures - in 2012, when they led a group to climb Mt. Kilimanjoro and raise funds for Digital Democracy. In 2013, Dan & Andrew of Seamless Planet traveled with me to Yangon, Myanmar to participate in BarCamp Yangon, an annual self-organized conference of Burmese technologists. We're thrilled to partner with Seamless Planet once again, and this time take our collaboration to the next level, by combining a trip to one of the world's most sacred places with a hands-on hackathon that will directly benefit our programs and partners.

_Why should you go?_
1) To put your technical skills to great use! You'll help build open-source tools that can be used by people around the globe working in low-tech environments to combat environmental & human rights threats.

2) To work directly with indigenous environmental monitors from Peru & Ecuador who are taking action to address oil contamination and environmental threats in remote parts of the rainforest.

3) To visit the Amazon & the bustling town of Tarapoto, Peru, located in the cloud forest.

4) To collaborate with incredible technologists & creators from around the world, including the Dd & Seamless Planet crews.

5) (Optional) To follow-up the hackathon with a trek to Machu Picchu, heart of the Incan Empire & one of the world's most  

_What's a hackathon, anyhow?_
It's a term for any event where a group of people come together to hack - ie build software or hardware - in a short, fast-paced timeframe. Think of a barnraising for the computer age. Given Dd's approach to tool development, honed over years of collaboration with marginalized groups who often have very limited tech experience, Dd takes a very particular approach to hackathons. 

Here are some of our key rules for successful hackathons.
1) Build _with_ - not for - local populations. The open source tech world is full of tools made with good intentions, but they're not always useful to local populations. Working with partners ensures the tools will be useful to the end users.

2) As much as possible, build tools where they will be used. In addition to increasing local participation, this helps us address local constraints - like low band-width, limited internet, cultural differences, etc - from the get go.

3) The greater the diversity of participants, the greater the success!

4) Plan for follow-up after the event. We know that the hackathon can never build a solution more than 85% of the way there - good tools require testing and iteration. To ensure that the work of November's hackathon is put to good use, Dd's partnering with Ecuadorian group (what's the name of Marti's group?) to hire two locally-based developers - one from Peru and one from Ecuador - to continue working with the tools developed in November through the end of 2015. We're committed to making sure that the tools we build will continue to be adapted to the needs of local users over time.

What will we be building in Peru? What technical expertise are we looking for?
The focus of the November Hackathon is to build cross-platform tools (mobile, tablet, offline-web) for gathering and managing monitoring data from the field, which includes water sample results, photos, quantitative and qualitative data, observations and interviews. The tools need to work in an entirely offline environment.

The key challenges we are trying to address are:
1) Improving the UX experience for users who are smart, fast learners, but who have never used a phone/tablet/laptop before.
2) Developing a way for 2-way offline peer-to-peer synchronization between devices in the field (e.g. between a phone and a tablet with a central data store) in the field, which can later be synchronized with the web. We have been looking at: CouchDB /PouchDB, using git / GitHub as a datastore, custom levelUp solution based on CouchDB, inspired by DAT.
3) Building offline workflows for photo and video data that needs to eventually reach a city up to 3 days away and upload using fast internet.
