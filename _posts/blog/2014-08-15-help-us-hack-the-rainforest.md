## Help us Hack the Rainforest

Calling all technologists, mobile app developers and passionate civic-techers: Digital Democracy is partnering with [Seamless Planet](http://seamlessplanet.com) to offer a one-of-kind opportunity to travel to the Peruvian Rainforest to collaborate with local indigenous activists who are working to document and respond to oil contamination and environmental threats in their communities. 

Dd first worked with Seamless Planet, an adventure travel  - in 2012, when they led a group to climb Mt. Kilimanjoro and raise funds for Digital Democracy. In 2013, Dan & Andrew of Seamless Planet traveled with me to Yangon, Myanmar to participate in BarCamp Yangon, an annual . We're thrilled to partner with Seamless Planet once again, and this time take our collaboration to the next level, by combining a trip to one of the world's most precious cultural & ecological heritage sights with a hands-on hackathon that will directly benefit our programs and partners.

What's a hackathon, anyhow? It's a term for any event for a group of people come together to program software or hardware (hack) in a shortened time frame. Think of a barnraising for the computer age. Given Dd's approach to tool development, honed over years of collaboration with marginalized groups who often have very limited tech experience, Dd takes a very particular approach to hackathons:
1) Build with and not for local populations. The open source tech world is full of tools made with good intentions, but not always useful to local populations.

2)Build tools where they will be used. Often, we're desiging for very specific constraints, and we think the best tools

Interested in joining us? Check out the full details and itinerary at Seamless Planet's website. Read below for the technical details we're looking for.

The focus of the work is building cross-platform tools (mobile, tablet, offline-web) for gathering an managing monitoring data from the field, which includes water sample results, photos, quantitative and qualitative data, observations and interviews. The tools need to work in an entirely offline environment.
The key challenges we are trying to address are:
1) Improving the UX experience for users who are smart, fast learners, but who have never used a phone/tablet/laptop before.
2) Developing a way for 2-way offline peer-to-peer synchronization between devices in the field (e.g. between a phone and a tablet with a central data store) in the field, which can later be synchronized with the web. We have been looking at: CouchDB /PouchDB, using git / GitHub as a datastore, custom levelUp solution based on CouchDB, inspired by DAT.
3) Building offline workflows for photo and video data that needs to eventually reach a city up to 3 days away and upload using fast internet.
