## Monitoring Illegal Mining with Support from Google Earth

Digital Democracy is a proud recipient of a [2013 Google Earth Outreach Developer Grant](http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/grants/developer/index.html). The award is given to non-profits to support their efforts to use maps to promote public benefit causes. Dd is using the grant to support the development of an early warning system to help the Wapichana people of Guyana incorporate satellite and remote sensing data into their efforts to stop illegal logging and mining. Partners on this project include software developers Whizzbang Systems, American Academy for the Advancement of Science's [GeoSpatial Technologies team](shr.aaas.org/geotech/flaring.shtml), [Forest People's Program](http://www.forestpeoples.org/) and Wapichana organization SCDPA.
