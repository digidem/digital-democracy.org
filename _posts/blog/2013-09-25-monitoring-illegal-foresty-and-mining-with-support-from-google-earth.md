Digital Democracy is a proud recipient of a [2013 Google Earth Outreach Developer Grant](http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/grants/developer/index.html). The award is given to non-profits to support their efforts to use maps to promote public benefit causes. Past recipients include the Nature Conservancy, the Jane Goodall Institute and the Clinton Foundation.

We're using the grant to build Wapichana Deforestation Alert System, an early warning system to help the Wapichana people of Guyana incorporate satellite and remote sensing data into their efforts to stop illegal logging and mining in an area covering 6 million acres. Partners on this project include software developers Whizbang Systems, American Academy for the Advancement of Science's [GeoSpatial Technologies team](shr.aaas.org/geotech/flaring.shtml), [Forest People's Program](http://www.forestpeoples.org/) and local monitors in Guyana.
