Today, in tandem with the [Indigenous Mapping
Workshop](http://indigenousmaps.com), the [Digital
Democracy](https://www.digital-democracy.org/) team is excited to announce the
**Earth Defenders’ Toolkit** (EDT), a collection of open-source tools and
training materials for communities on the frontlines of the struggle to defend
critical ecosystems around the world.

## How does it work?

The toolkit will contain [mapping,
monitoring](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/) and
[digital-storytelling](https://terrastories.io/) tools that can be used by
communities to:

- Document & understand rapid changes & threats to territory
- Create maps to communicate history & connection to land
- Document human rights & environmental abuses
- Reinforce local advocacy with concrete evidence
- Tell their story to the world

## Our Approach

While distinct in functionality, all of the tools are
[value-aligned](https://www.digital-democracy.org/blog/solidarity-technology-values-for-an-earth-defender-s-toolkit/)
and have the following in common:

- built in partnership with frontline communities,
- entirely open-source,
- work offline,
- allow communities to own & manage their own data.

In the coming months, we will use tried and tested approaches to develop
training materials that leverage technology to support local autonomy
and ownership over data, and avoid creating dependencies on outside
support.

In addition to providing a channel for tool access and training support,
EDT will also build a collaborative platform for local community
organizations and their allies and partners to co-create the toolkit and
share digital knowledge. [Join the EDT
community](http://earthdefenderstoolkit.com/) by signing up for
the mailing list, and we'll keep you posted on how to get involved.

## Why now?

EDT is the result of over 15 years of work with communities facing
urgent threats of environmental and political abuses. The comprehensive
toolkit will collect critical tools and connect users with the
appropriate technology for their particular needs. The collaborative
platform will cultivate knowledge sharing and ensure ongoing
improvements to the toolkit.

The toolkit was conceived long before the COVID-19 pandemic, however,
the rapidly changing global context has made the need for such a
resource all the more evident. While travel has been restricted and many
projects have been halted, unchecked resource extraction continues to
threaten the lives of Indigenous peoples and the future of the entire
planet. EDT is a critical channel for ensuring that frontline
communities have access to effective tools to defend their homes.
