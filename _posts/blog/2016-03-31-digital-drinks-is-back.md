The Amazon is muggy, but Oakland is perfectly sunny. Celebrate the change of seasons and meet other technologists for good at our first Digital Drinks of 2016. 

Grab a beer and a burger with us at Telegraph Beer Garden from 5-7 PM on April 20. Team Digital Democracy will just be back from our board and staff retreat in Guyana, full of new ideas and fresh stories. Get the scoop on our plans for this year (including a sneak peek at our next Hack the Rainforest) and meet other technologists, designers, and organizers with a passion for using technology to defend rights.
