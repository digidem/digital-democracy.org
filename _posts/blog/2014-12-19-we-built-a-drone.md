Hello world.

Calling all technologists, mobile app developers and passionate civic-hackers: Digital Democracy is partnering with [Seamless Planet](http://seamlessplanet.com) to offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to the Peruvian Rainforest and collaborate with local indigenous leaders to design and build a mobile data collection app to empower their work to defend their territory.

## What's at stake?

Across the Amazon, and rainforests around the globe, indigenous people face multiple threats, including oil contamination, pollution from mining, and deforestation. Dd is supporting [local communities who are working to document and respond to oil contamination and environmental threats](http://www.digital-democracy.org/blog/update-on-remote-access/) in the Peruvian & Ecuadorian Amazon.

## Why should you go?

1. To put your technical skills to great use! You'll help build open-source tools that can be used by people around the globe working in low-tech environments to combat environmental & human rights threats.

2. To work directly with indigenous environmental monitors from Peru & Ecuador who are taking action to address oil contamination and environmental threats in remote parts of the rainforest.

3. To visit the Amazon & the bustling town of Tarapoto, Peru, located in the cloud forest.
