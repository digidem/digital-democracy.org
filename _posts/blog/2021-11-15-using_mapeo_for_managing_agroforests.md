title: Using Mapeo for Managing Agroforests
published: true
date: 2021-10-29
excerpt: Mapeo has been successfully used in many cases as a tool for defending
  the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, and consequently forests
  around the globe. In this post we’ll explore agroforestry through my
  experiences around my house and some larger scale projects around Brazil. This
  personal journey got me thinking how digital technology can assist reforesting
  projects, and how Mapeo can be a great fit.

Let’s start by digging into how different cultures occupy the land.
