Today we're launching [Earth Defenders
Toolkit](https://earthdefenderstoolkit.com), a collaborative space for earth
defenders and their allies. The Toolkit provides a growing collection of
resources and training materials for communities on the frontlines of the
struggle to defend critical ecosystems around the world, and community networks
for users to connect and share their experiences, and was built in collaboration
with many of our close partners around the world.

Why did we build the Toolkit? Over the past year, while the Covid-19
pandemic has halted most travel, we've seen threats against Indigenous
and other frontline defenders increase. For many of our partners, the
pandemic has brought dual threats of disease AND increased invasion of
their territories by illegal loggers and miners. At the same time, more
and more communities are reaching out to request support and trainings
on how to use technology to protect their land, and we created Earth
Defenders Toolkit as a way to share success stories and best practices,
advice on how to determine what tools are right for a particular
project, and foster community between frontline communities around the
world.

Our goal with Earth Defenders Toolkit is to provide and promote
approaches to using technology in a way that supports local autonomy and
ownership over tools and data, and reduces reliance on outside support.
The website is available in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, and
includes a [community
forum](https://forum.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/), [case
studies](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/Community/), an
[interactive
tool-finder](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/toolfinder/)
and [featured
tools](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/toolkit/).
