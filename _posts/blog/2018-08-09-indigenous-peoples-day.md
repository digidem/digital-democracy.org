**Tell us a little about yourself:** My name is Oswando Nenquimo, normally known as Opi and I’m 35 years old. I am Waorani and I grew up in the community of Nemonpare. I’ve been working visiting the communities for the mapping since 2015.

**What inspires you:** I’ve always been inspired to help the Waorani nation to organize itself and regain its autonomy. I’ve spent a long time wondering how to protect our territory. The Pastaza river basin where I grew up inspires me because it has not yet been affected by oil extraction or other major threats. I want to defend it. I have always dreamed and had the vision that my people should be happy and live freely and peacefully within our territory.

**Where does your strength come from:** As Waorani we always have visions and dreams that guide our life in the jungle, and in this we follow in the steps of our ancestors who also had dreams and visions. They also inspire us, we always speak of the pikinani, the ancestors and warriors who give us our vision.

**How do you work with Digital Democracy** Dd is an important ally to the Waorani team, they provide us with technical support in order to learn and use equipment around our territory. It’s important, not just for us but for all the communities who need this work. I have learned new things, how to use a GPS and the mapping program on the computer, and this has been my favorite part of the mapping work. I really like drawing maps on the computer.
The work we are doing is to show the world all the richness and diversity that we Waorani have on our land. We show this on printed maps, digital maps, on the web page. We want to share this with the world and show how we are collecting and recording our knowledge with the help of technology.

**Something you want to share with us:** I have heard many songs from the women in different villages who sing when we arrive, and talk about people who have come from afar. I don’t know the words exactly but one talks about a parrot that is flying from a really long way away towards our green territory. It stretches its wings wide like a condor and then arrives. The parrot sits on a branch and sings, and then starts building a nest, and then its babies are born.This is how people talk about you arriving from Digital Democracy and bringing the technology. It’s a really long song, and there are lots of different ones that I have heard that different women sing.
