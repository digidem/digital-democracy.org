On July 21st, [Digital Democracy](https://www.digital-democracy.org/), [Natural Justice](https://naturaljustice.org/) and [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org/en) hosted the [Africa Forum for Earth Defenders](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/africa-forum-register/). This two-hour virtual event brought together over 120 participants, primarily earth defenders from across the African continent, to share stories of work they are doing on the frontlines, and highlight new tools and strategies that help put power in the hands of local communities. 

We began the event with a moment of silence in recognition of the earth defenders across the continent who have been killed in the past year, including Joannah Stutchbury, Esmond Bradley Martin, Esther Mwikali, Robert Kiprotich, Fikile Ntshangase, and Bazooka Rhadebe. 

Next, Eva Maria Okoth of Natural Justice moderated conversations with featured speakers  from Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
