Digital Democracy and a coalition of international partners are launching a new program aimed at halting deforestation in the Amazon. The program, All Eyes on the Amazon, has been made possible thanks to a 14.8 million euro contribution from the Dutch National Postcode Lotteryâ€™s Dream Fund. It will combine modern technologies, such as satellites, drones and tablets, with the centuries old knowledge of Indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon. 

All Eyes on the Amazon is a multi-year initiative led by [Hivos](https://hivos.org/) and Greenpeace, with leadership and oversight from [COICA](http://coica.org.ec/), Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin. Additional project partners include the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), the World Resources Institute (WRI), the University of Maryland (UMD), INTERPOL LEAF, and the NGOS Both ENDS, WITNESS and ARTICLE 19.
