**Tell us a little about yourself:** My name is Oswando Nenquimo, but everyone calls me Opi and I’m 35 years old. I am Waorani and I grew up in the community of Nemonpare, in the Amazon in Ecuador. I’ve been working visiting the communities with the mapping team since 2015.

**What inspires you:** I’ve always been inspired to help the Waorani nation to organize itself and regain its autonomy, and I’ve spent a long time wondering how best to protect our territory. The Pastaza river basin where I grew up inspires me because it has not yet been affected by oil extraction or other major threats. I want to defend it. I have always dreamed and had the vision that my people should be happy and live freely and peacefully within our territory.

**Where does your strength come from:** As Waorani we always have visions and dreams that guide our life in the jungle, and in this we follow in the steps of our ancestors who also had dreams and visions. They too inspire us, we always speak of the pikinani, the elders, ancestors and warriors who give us our vision.

**How do you work with Digital Democracy** Digital Democracy is an important ally to the Waorani team as they provide us with technical support in order to learn and use equipment to defend our territory. It’s important, not just for us but for all the communities who need these kinds of tools. I have learned new things, how to use a GPS and how to make maps on the computer, which has been one of my favourite parts of the mapping work. We are making maps to show the world all the richness and diversity that we Waorani have on our land. We are making printed maps, digital maps, web-maps. We want to share these with the world, and show how we are collecting and recording our knowledge with the help of technology.

**Something you want to share with us:** I have heard many songs from the women in villages throughout Waorani lands who sing when we arrive, and talk about people who have come from afar. I don’t know the words exactly but one song tells of a parrot that is flying from a really long way away towards our green territory. It stretches its wings wide like a condor and eventually arrives. The parrot sits on a branch and sings, and starts building a nest, and then later its babies are born. This is how people talk about people arriving from Digital Democracy and bringing the technology. It’s a really long song, one of many that I have heard different women sing.
