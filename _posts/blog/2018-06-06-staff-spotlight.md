Later this year, Digital Democracy will be celebrating our ten year anniversary. Over the last decade, the organization has evolved in scope and impact. A huge factor in this evolution is the growing team of passionate  and brilliant people who have made Dd what it is today.

For Digital Democracy, our current work is about our partners living on the frontlines of oil extraction and land-grabs. The Dd staff lives and works for its values - to be sidekicks for the real heroes who are protecting their ancestral lands.

That said, the Dd staff are amazing people and deserve a shoutout for their commitment to this work.

Meet the team


## Hi, I’m Aldo Puicon!

I practice design at the intersection of [people, equity, and sustainability](https://medium.com/@aldopuicon/people-progress-sustainability-ideas-to-guide-our-practice-work-aa87e55c18df#.z7wjjy8i1). To do so, I partner with visionary people and organizations to co-design radical strategies and solutions.

Outside of Digital Democracy, I’m an active member of Color Coded, an LA-based POC-driven technology collective developing public programs, incubating technology projects, and mentoring people of all ages and skill levels who are wanting to practice technology and design within an intersectionality framework.

On a more personal note: I was born in Lima (Peru), and my family immigrated to Los Angeles in the early 80s. I am a lifelong Angeleno who speaks and reads fluent Spanish. I identify as Queer and Latinx, and my pronouns are they and them. Besides design, I am also passionate about technology, art, maps, and storytelling.

**What do you focus on at Dd?** At the moment, I focus on designing the user experience and interface for Mapeo Mobile 1.0. This first version of Mapeo Mobile will make it easy for our partners to gather qualitative and quantitative mapping data while helping them stay organized.

**What inspires you the most about your work?** I am most inspired by the vision for the Mapeo platform and its potential to positively impact not only our partners' missions but my own communities' needs. The power of maps and mapping data is critical in framing conversations regarding land rights and land use — whether deep in the Amazon or in gentrifying neighborhoods across the States.

**What is a piece of media that you’d like to share with the Digital Democracy community?** French Disko by Stereolab (1994) … When I was 14, my good friend Melanie introduced me to the sounds of Stereolab, an English band with a French chanteuse and several Moogs and guitars. Their sound would occupy my ears time and time again throughout my high school experience until they were forced out by other new sounds I came across. Over 20 years later, I have revisited Stereolab… this time diving deeper into their politics. This particular track is both nostalgic yet more relevant today than before…
