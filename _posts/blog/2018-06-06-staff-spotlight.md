Later this year, Digital Democracy will be celebrating our ten year anniversary. Over the last decade, the organization has evolved in scope and impact. A huge factor in this evolution is the growing team of passionate  and brilliant people who have made Dd what it is today.

For Digital Democracy, our current work is about our partners living on the frontlines of oil extraction and land-grabs. The Dd staff lives and works for its values - to be sidekicks for the real heroes who are protecting their ancestral lands.

That said, the Dd staff are amazing people and deserve a shoutout for their commitment to this work.

Meet the team


## Hi, I’m Aldo Puicon!

![Aldo Puicon](/assets/aldo-sunny.jpg)

I practice design at the intersection of [people, equity, and sustainability](https://medium.com/@aldopuicon/people-progress-sustainability-ideas-to-guide-our-practice-work-aa87e55c18df#.z7wjjy8i1). To do so, I partner with visionary people and organizations to co-design radical strategies and solutions.

Outside of Digital Democracy, I’m an active member of Color Coded, an LA-based POC-driven technology collective developing public programs, incubating technology projects, and mentoring people of all ages and skill levels who are wanting to practice technology and design within an intersectionality framework.

On a more personal note: I was born in Lima (Peru), and my family immigrated to Los Angeles in the early 80s. I am a lifelong Angeleno who speaks and reads fluent Spanish. I identify as Queer and Latinx, and my pronouns are they and them. Besides design, I am also passionate about technology, art, maps, and storytelling.

**What do you focus on at Dd?** At the moment, I focus on designing the user experience and interface for Mapeo Mobile 1.0. This first version of Mapeo Mobile will make it easy for our partners to gather qualitative and quantitative mapping data while helping them stay organized.

**What inspires you the most about your work?** I am most inspired by the vision for the Mapeo platform and its potential to positively impact not only our partners' missions but my own communities' needs. The power of maps and mapping data is critical in framing conversations regarding land rights and land use — whether deep in the Amazon or in gentrifying neighborhoods across the States.

**What is a piece of media that you’d like to share with the Digital Democracy community?** French Disko by Stereolab (1994) … When I was 14, my good friend Melanie introduced me to the sounds of Stereolab, an English band with a French chanteuse and several Moogs and guitars. Their sound would occupy my ears time and time again throughout my high school experience until they were forced out by other new sounds I came across. Over 20 years later, I have revisited Stereolab… this time diving deeper into their politics. This particular track is both nostalgic yet more relevant today than before…

## Hi, I’m Aliya Ryan!

I was born and brought up in the UK in a food, travel and people loving family whose regular perambulations took myself and my sisters between the dreaming spires of Oxford and Cambridge, the wild, boggy, moss-filled Scottish Borders, the crystal clear alpine air of Lake Zurich and ancient sites of mystical & culinary knowledge in modern day Turkey.

My interest and desire to challenge and see beyond my worldview, and an inability to remain inactive when witnessing injustice and inequality led me to study anthropology and subsequently move to Peru, where my love affair with the Amazon and its people took hold.  

Now I live in Edinburgh, am feeling joy at the arrival of elderflower in the hedgerows and dusk that turns into dawn in the magical midsummer Scottish twilight. And I’m learning the trapeze for the day I run away to the circus...

**What do you focus on at Dd?** My role is to oversee Dd’s relationships with our partner communities and make sure that our tech development not only takes into account their needs, but is led by them so that the tools we make can be both useful and impactful, and also reduce dependence and build local autonomy. I do this by visiting the communities and seeing the tools in action, and lots of coordination at a distance. I also spend a fair amount of time travelling, making maps, preparing training and workshop materials and am the first point of contact for people enquiring to use Mapeo in new areas.

**What inspires you the most about your work?** All the people that I am lucky to work alongside, spend time with and count amongst my close colleagues and friends.

I feel particularly lucky to be able to spend quality time with our partners in the field, often visiting their beautiful homelands and seeing first hand the threats they are facing and their efforts to confront these through community mobilisation, capacity building and mapping and monitoring efforts. This is a frequent reality check for me to ensure that our tools remain grounded in real needs.

The tech world was new to me when I joined Digital Democracy, but through it I have also been introduced to radically subversive, genius and inspiring people using tech to build more collaborative, distributed and kind systems which I believe can help bring positive change.

**What is a piece of media that you’d like to share with the Digital Democracy community?**
The [decolonial atlas blog](https://decolonialatlas.wordpress.com/author/decolonialatlas/) which publishes maps that undermine colonial / imperial views and show alternative or maginalised ways of seeing and relating to space. In the same vein Hugh Brody’s beautiful book Maps and Dreams, which inspired me twenty years ago to start working in the area of indigenous land rights. More recently the reflections of Renee Paulani Louis on the challenges of being a contemporary indigenous cartographer and the gorgeous and imaginative maps of James Cheshire and Oliver Uberti shown in Where the Animals Go.

## Hi, I’m Cindy Zeng!

I work on mapeo-mobile as a developer for Digital Democracy.  I’m inspired by the possibility that the Mapeo ecosystem provides. Ideally, Mapeo ecosystem would help empower people/communities in a way that feels intuitive and natural without exploitation. It’s inspirational to see the team work and think through solutions in a way that puts the user/communities first to make sure that communities own the product instead of the other way around.

**Is there a person or group from your work with Dd that has particularly inspired you?** The person who has particularly inspired me, probably by way of just being the one I’ve worked closest with, is Aldo. Aldo has inspired me to approach problems both in work and life in a completely different way. Their approach to problem solving blends together the impatient get-it-done attitude that I’ve become accustomed to in the private sector and the warmth, understanding, and emotional intuition that is unique to Aldo. When approached with a problem, their attitude is never accusatory or defeated, but inquisitive, empowering and supportive. “How can I help support you?” is always the first question they ask. Working with Aldo never feels like work and is always filled with laughter and warmth. I can’t say I have a particular story that sticks out in my mind of Aldo’s inspiration, but I will say when I think back to my interactions with them, each and every one has prompted me to learn something new about myself or the world. Perhaps that’s what’s truly inspiring about them, they bring out the best and most productive from a person, not through exploitation, force, or impatience, but through kindness, understanding, and just the right amount of sass.

## Hi, I’m Helena Qin!

I am a curious mind, passionate cook and foodie, that person who will pet your dog, and (at times) a software developer. Outside of Digital Democracy, I also work at Intuit as a front-end engineer based in Mountain View, California, though I love to eat my way through travelling.

**What do you focus on at Dd?** I focus on Mapeo Mobile as a front-end developer, helping to connect indigenous communities with access to technology that will help tell their stories and protect their land and culture.

**What inspires you the most about your work?** The possibilities for positive impact and change that Mapeo has on communities and people inspire me. The technology that we are building is taking a different approach by working alongside our partners to come up with solutions that will make a difference, as they truly own their data and stories.

The people that make up Digital Democracy also inspire me. Everyone brings unique perspectives that have inspired me to think about issues much bigger than myself, and ultimately have inspired me to do better to help bring change through technology.

**What is a piece of media that you’d like to share with the Digital Democracy community?**
The “Comfort Zone” episode of NPR’s Ted Radio Hour podcast, here. This episode discusses ideas about pushing us out of our comfort zones, from facing our fears and taking risks, to hard issues like talking about race and privilege.

My favorite section in the podcast is with humanitarian activist Dan Pallotta. He talks about the importance of community, as we seem to have an abundance of the word community, but a lack in actual community. Dan speaks of “our inability to be with one another that gives rise to so many of the problems” that we currently have, which really resonates with me.
