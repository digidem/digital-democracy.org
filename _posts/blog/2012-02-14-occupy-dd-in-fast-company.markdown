The concept of "small-d democracy" is at the foundation of our work at Digital Democracy. Fast Company's March 2012 issue features Dd in solidarity with other innovators who have helped elevate, amplify and fortify the Occupy Movement.[![image](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7194/6876885035_b84c7e84df_b.jpg)](http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/occupy-movement)




This fall, Dd challenged the claim that "the Occupy Movement doesn't know what it wants" by building a polling system on the open source All Our Ideas platform to ask them to speak for themselves. After collecting 96,586 votes on 40 original ideas and 30 user-generated ideas to answer which ideas they liked better, the top two choices are "the stripping of corporate personhood" and "to spend more money on education than on the military."
