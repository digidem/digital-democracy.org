Tessa is a member of the Wapichan forest monitoring team that we've been supporting over the past several years, and visited in Guyana last month. After a couple of weeks being impressed by her wit, patience, and technical ability, we finally sat down to ask her about her experiences, and why she decided to become a forest monitor. <a class="play-link">Watch the video</a> to hear what she had to say.
