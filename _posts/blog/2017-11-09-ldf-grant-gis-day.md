Digital Democracy Announces $525,000 Grant from Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation
Funds to be used to Build Out Mapping Tool for Indigenous Communities

San Francisco, CA: This World GIS Day, US-based nonprofit  Digital Democracy is celebrating a $525,000 grant from the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to build-out their innovative mapping tool Mapeo.

“World GIS Day is a celebration of how GIS technology is applied, and today Digital Democracy celebrates with the public launch of Mapeo thanks to this matching-grant from the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation,” said Emily Jacobi, Digital Democracy Executive Director.  “For the past four years we have been working directly with indigenous communities in the Amazon to test and prototype tools for mapping and territorial monitoring. With this investment from the DiCaprio Foundation we are looking to match this support from other donors and build a mobile app prototype in the next year. Our vision is for the full Mapeo desktop and mobile suite to be used by communities all over the world..”

Working with indigenous peoples and other marginalized communities across the globe, Digital Democracy builds mapping and documentation technology to equip local groups with tools they need to protect their territory from threats including illegal mining and land-grabs. Digital Democracy is currently prototyping tools with partners across the Amazon region, but have specifically piloted Mapeo with partners Alianza Ceibo & Amazon Frontlines in the Ecuadorian Amazon, who are using it to map and defend their ancestral territory of 800 000 hectares of Amazon rainforest.

“With Mapeo we have, for the first time, a tool that we can use to make our own maps, and we can build a strong team of people who can train others to map,” said Opi Nenquimo, the Waorani project lead.  “The mapping project has united many villages to defend and manage their lands together. And it is a process which is leaving a legacy for the future, both the maps and the skills, that our people can use to fight for our livelihoods and our rights.”

Digital Democracy is seeking matching support from other foundations and individual donors for 2018. Over the next few years the organization aims to acquire multi-million dollar investments for the technical development of Mapeo mobile app and desktop suite. They are also setting goals to work directly with communities in new regions outside of the Amazon.

“The technology of Mapeo is not the solution, rather it is how it enables the communities to collaborate and document the world around them so that they are empowered to stop environmental injustices and human rights abuses,” said Jacobi.


> If you are interested in the technical workings of Mapeo, all our development is happening in the open [on GitHub](https://github.com/digidem/) where you can follow along and, if you have time and the skills, jump into the issues and help us fix some things.
