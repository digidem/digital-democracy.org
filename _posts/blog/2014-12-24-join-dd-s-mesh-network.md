What does it mean to join the Mesh Network? Four things:
1) Support our work by giving a generous contribution. For those who can afford it, we're requesting support at the $1000 level or higher. We're a small lean organization, so support at this level goes a far way. If this is out of your ability, please consider giving what you can, and making a recurring monthly donation to support Dd's work.
2) Connect us to others who might be excited to join the Mesh Network.
3) Open doors. Do you have institutional connections that might be interested in supporting Dd's work? 
4) Most importantly, keep in touch with us and learn about our work so that you can be an ambassador for Digital Democracy in the future! In 2015 the Mesh Network will be on the front lines of hearing about our work as it evolves in real time.
