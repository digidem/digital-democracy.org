### Cesia Domínguez López, is the Co-founder of Color Coded, a POC-only space and collective co-teaching, co-creating, and co-owning new technologies. To learn more about their work, visit: <https://colorcoded.la/>

**Karissa**

What sparked you to start Color Coded?

**Cesia**

Color Coded started while we were doing anti-displacement work in Los Angeles before the term “gentrification” and much less “displacement” were part of the narrative.  \

The origin in color coded is rooted in my story. In the 90s, I was part of the generation where the Internet didn't happen until middle school. I went to an academy for math engineering and science in high school. I didn't have access to a computer at home, but I was going to school with students that had not just one but also multiple screens, and who were learning how to code in high school. They had access to that through a STEM high school education. For someone who didn't have a computer at home, and undocumented in Salt Lake City, I was contending with the questions of who gets access to things, who gets to own things?

I did neuroscience in undergrad, and computer science is something that's always talked about. I wanted to learn about it, but being in a predominantly white institution, in the sciences there was one black professor and one latino lab assistant. 

It became really frustrating because most of the students within the sciences were predominantly middle class, white, a lot of them trying to do pre-med. They didn't have lived experiences of how these things we talked about in the classroom affected working people of color.

I left feeling angry, I had known about interlocking systems of domination, heteronormativity, capitalism, religion, and whiteness as an ideology. I knew about it growing up but I didn't have a language to talk about it until I left. And because of all of these students I interacted with, it became important for me to have a safe space to learn.

We don't want to do that labor or slow down to explain these topics to folks. We wanted a safe space where we didn't have to do that emotional labor and educational labor.

**Karissa**

What did it look like when it first started and how did it evolve?

**Cesia**

I was working in the NGO industrial complex, working in the tech industry as well, touching the corporate world a little bit. It became clear during the first couple of years, we started meeting over our kitchen table and taking up space as we could. When my kitchen table wasn't big enough we had to look for space. I had a lot of office space available, and we would meet there after hours.

In the first 1-2 years, we would joke about it as a 'support group' and being disillusioned about what was possible in our jobs. Especially as an undocumented person, you are told to get a bachelors, get a job, that you'll get access... that wasn't a reality. We needed a space for healing moments together as well, heal from it, and take action.

If we're seeing this as a challenge, as an issue, we’re now thinking about solutions as well. It's also thinking about youth and other community members we are attached to. I'm the oldest of four. I don't like talking about it in terms of the digital divide, it doesn't capture what's happening. I'm in community with lots of folks who don't have access or don't use computers in the same way I use computers. So we started thinking about how we can uplift technologies that people create.

The way our work is sustained is getting hired by non-profits that need tech support. We have a worker-owned offshoot within where people take that contract. 30% of the profits go to the collective fund to take care of community members that need it.

We're 5 years in and we want to celebrate that. We had to make the choice to let go of the physical space this year. We had plans to open up more of a community space so that people part of the collective are now living in that space, we were having those conversations in Jan/Feb, and with all this going on… there isn't a need for a physical space for people to gather yet. So that's on hold, and wondering what that looks like post-COVID.

**Karissa**

What does ‘uplifting technologies’ look like?

**Cesia**

We want to uplift technologies outside of the western definition. Invite community members who are using tech in a different way. The way we define technology is an applied process, it's about intentionality, it's about rigor, it's about discipline, and really studying what you're trying to problem solve. We know that communities of color have been doing that for generations, for decades. Lots of these technologies are not celebrated because of western definitions.

For example, we have invited different herbalists that think about plant medicine, plant technology. Resistance technologies, for example youth on the street using graffiti as a way to have their voices heard. Maybe they aren't building a website, but they're using a platform to communicate. There is a whole intentionality of processes built-in with art making.

**Karissa**

I'm happy you brought in art, because most technology today is made for profit. Can you talk a bit more about the corporate domination of technologies and how Color Coded relates to it?

**Cesia**

We don't engage in corporate tech. It's been interesting to navigate. A lot of folks can't place us in the tech industry because we aren't friends with folks in the tech industry. When mi gente launched the No tech for ICE campaign, people understood that they needed to think about technology and that it is important.

Think about tech in your organizing, We had to do a little bit of that bridge building. We were excited when there was a whole conference targeting movements, and how technology relates. It wasn't at the front of mind... and now in this moment, it's in the front of mind for many people doing organize.

**Karissa**

I’m glad you mentioned organizing. Can you talk a bit about technology now in this moment of mass organizing and mobilization?

**Cesia**

We worked on an art and practice space about abolition, and abolition technologies, called [\#EmbodyAbolition #BuildManyWorlds](https://embodyabolition.us/). For people who are targeted by surveillance, they know what the threats are. We know that we don't want all of these carceral technologies, body cams,  police, jails.

But what do we want instead? A lot of us don't know what that alternative world could look like. For us, it's about imagination. We try something, we will experiment. If it works -- great! If it doesn't, try again. Science has a lot of those rules and tenants, too. Constantly exploring, being creative. Creativity and imagination around what abolition technologies are is really important for us, as well as making sure people have access to those tools and spaces.

For working class black and brown communities, they don't have a space where they get asked: “What would your world look like if you didn't have to deal with the police?” 

We like to say abolition isn't a destination or deliverable... it's being co-opted by non-profits. It's a process. How do you practice abolition tech? How do you practice abolition? How do you embody those carceral technologies? I know that I have anti-blackness, capitalistic notions, as someone who has grown up in it, how can we think of different ways to be in this world?

I want to give a shout out to los zapatistas. one world where many worlds fit. That's what we think about when we say we build many worlds. One solution is not going to be right for everyone.

As soon as you start defining what utopia looks like, you start excluding folks. It's part of the technology process. An analogy to use is if you're not constantly maintaining and keeping track of your tech, it's got a bug, it's going to break. So we want to do that maintenance within ourselves too.

**Karissa**

Amazing, I LOVE that you make that analogy between tech maintenance and maintenance inside ourselves! What other easy have you been thinking about movements in relation to corporate tech?

**Cesia**

We know that we can't rely on most tech companies or tech products to keep us safe. Especially now, yesterday, the CEO of zoom is going to be working with law enforcement. Those folks are the same. We know that amazon and these big tech companies are all connected to ICE, DHS, getting tons of funding for this police work. Migente did a lot of great work tracking the contracts in their no tech for ice campaign.

We don't want to be reactionary, and we have long-standing conversations. How do we have healthy relationships with technology? How do we cultivate healthy tech environments? It's one thing to do interpersonal analysis, but how about the infrastructure it is built upon that comes into place?

We know that most of the tech we use harms black and brown communities. Lithium batteries are all causing contamination for land and communities. How do we take this into account for all bodies? Not just human bodies, but bodies of land, bodies of people, bodies of plants, bodies of animals.

Autonomy is also something I'd like to highlight. It's not enough to create our own apps, if we don’t have control and autonomy around the infrastructure. One of the demands could be an Internet owned by the people and for the people. This can apply to all sorts of technologies and utilities, electricity, water, and these infrastructures that are built. Having access and control over these utilities is what will give us autonomy and get our needs met.

That's one thing we are trying to figure out what to talk about. Every community doesn't have the capacity to build their own Internet, to build their own p2p secure network. For people to have autonomy is to have ownership of these utilities.

**Karissa**

That’s very important work. As part of this series we’ve also highlighted work from Rhizomatic, which is building community networks in Oaxaca, Mexico, which you might be interested in. Another question I have, what would you tell a funder or donor that agrees with everything you’ve said and wants to contribute to this kind of work?

**Cesia**

First, sustainability of folks who have already been doing the work.

Now that abolition is “sexy” for example, there are all of these groups that get funding for abolition work. But some of these groups actually do reform-based work instead. And groups that are doing the on-the-ground work are not given resources.

Another thing -- no strings attached. If you're going to give money, don't require reports, orgs have their own way of evaluating the work. There are a few folks that have been doing that work -- Movement Generation has been moving away from extractive economies to regenerative economies. 

When Trans Queer Puelblo got a knock on the door from the bigger non-profits, they had to negotiate. They said, these funders will not change the way we do our reports. They asked them to invest in power building. The folks that have the best solutions and creativity are the folks who are living and existing in these communities. Getting the money to their hands directly is more important. A lot of these folks come out of user experience work, and apply it to their organizing. It means that trans mujeres that got released from a detention center are now leading the work. They are now evaluating, reporting on their own work. 

We like to say we don't build for people, we build with people. We want to make sure you have the skills to make it sustainable, so you can have ownership and adopt it to whatever the local needs might be.

**Karissa**

Wow, yes this is so important -- this white supremacy culture and patriarchal attitude is not helpful and supportive to groups that are busy getting the work done. Can you say a little bit more about co-design and how that plays into your process of ‘getting the work done’?

**Cesia**

Respectful technologies. I want to give a shout out to Dori Tunstall, the dean of Ontario College of Art and Design. In Canada, where they have reverse racism, they talk about decolonizing design.

We are not ready to talk about decolonizing design and technology in the United States, until we have certain things that Canada has, like reverse racism being legal. Decolonizing is just a buzzword and rooted in academia and theory rather than praxis. We didn't want to say decolonizing tech because that's not where we are at in the U.S.

We are at the place of “respectful tech” where there are a few guiding questions that we have. One: “Am I actually the right person to do this work?” Maybe it's not my role. Instead of trying to work with black feminists as a white man, maybe I shouldn't do that. Maybe I should give funding resources, train black women so that they can work with those folks.

*“Am I being respectful to my body and other bodies?”*

Sometimes folks think that we need the solution! In western progressive, and tech world, the progress narrative.. sometimes we don't need that. Sometimes it's unnecessary. Sometimes analog is actually better. Is this even actually needed and is a big part of the question? Slowing down is a method for this. Intentionality. If you're being intentional, you're going to go slow. You're building relationships with folks, deep listening, listening again. Am I being respectful to other bodies? Am I building a technology that perpetuates extraction, bodies of water, bodies of land? We have crafted a workshop and slidedeck that you can use to help put it together.
