We’re hiring. Are you a javascript developer with a passion for maps, the rainforest, human rights, or making a difference doing cool stuff? [Join our dynamic team](/jobs/javascript-developer), building cutting edge tools to meet the needs of indigenous communities in [Peru](/blog/update-on-remote-access/), Ecuador, [Guyana](/ourwork/guyana/) and around the world who are on the front lines of the struggle to protect the world’s most beautiful places.

We’re building a mobile web-app for offline monitoring of environmental and human rights abuses by indigenous communities in remote locations. If you have experience building web apps, working with [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/), developing for [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) / [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) and participating in open source projects, we’d love to hear from you.

As well as leading development on our mobile app you would be managing our growing library of open source libraries on [Github](https://github.com/digidem/), from [backend node apps](https://github.com/digidem/simple-odk) to [small front-end modules](https://github.com/digidem/xhr-offline) to make the web work where there’s no internet.

[More details and how to apply](/jobs/javascript-developer).
