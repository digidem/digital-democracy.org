### K: What are the most pressing issues for nonprofit technology today?  

I'm trying to birth a paper, about controlling our digital destiny -- about
having alternative infrastructure that we actually control. So much about what
we're trying to do is move away from talking about technology, and more towards
talking about data. The anthology of the non-profit sector, is that technology
has line items & budgets, but data is not part of that conversation. In other
words, they worry more about they tech they get, than the data. We are looking
to flip that narrative.

From a game theoretic standpoint, we've already lost. For example, if you're in
a room with a toddler who just locked into something, you can see their eyes,
you know their future. If it's an inanimate object, you gotta get the camera.
If it's an electrical socket, you see that they're going to put their finger in
it -- you intervene. If it's an animal, you do a threat model, that is, is the
cat cute or will it scratch the kid's face off? This threat modeling is what we
need to do with our data. By putting the data in the corporate cloud, we are
that kid. We are giving corporations and governments a way to see what we are
looking towards, and they can predict our future. 

We are addicted to phones that track us 24/7 and know everything we do. Idiots
continue to buy home surveillance-ware and hardware so we are trending in all
the wrong directions. We should be fighting hard and not have our data in the
control of corporations and governments.

If you want to talk about impact stories for non-profit and civil society, you
need to understand what is at risk and stand in solidarity with those
practicing data minimalism and data stewardship. 

### K: As a leader in the non profit techology scene, you must have seen a wide breadth of projects over the years. What projects have had the most impact that are still active today?

Signal, Wordpress

### K: Where are the biggest gaps, and who is trying to fill them?


### K: For those reading this who are involved in non-profit technology; either
supporting an existing project or making a new one, do you have some advice?


### K: I'm sure there are many people reading this now who want to do something to help this movement against surveillance capital. What would you say to those who want to enter into this space?
