This week, I was able to sit down with Allen Gunn (AKA Gunner) from Aspiration
Tech. Gunner is the Executive Director of Aspiration (www.aspirationtech.org)
in San Francisco, USA, and works to help NGOs, activists, foundations and
software developers make more effective use of technology for social change.

The common thread that connects all facets of Gunner's work is a focus on open
approaches to capacity building and knowledge sharing in social change efforts.
We wanted to speak with him as part of our new Technology Solidarity series,
where we're taking a moment to explore what we've learned in conversation with
others working at the intersection of technology and social justice.


### K: You have a 10,000-foot view of this space. What do you think are the
most pressing issues for nonprofit technology and social movements today?  

*Gunner*: I'm trying to birth a paper about controlling our digital destiny -- about
having alternative infrastructure that we actually control. So much about what
we're trying to do is move away from talking about technology, and more towards
talking about data. The anthology of the non-profit sector, is that technology
has line items & budgets, but data is not part of that conversation. In other
words, they worry more about they tech they get than they worry about the data.
We are looking to flip that narrative.

From a game theoretic standpoint, we've already lost. For example, if you're in
a room with a toddler who just locked into something, you can see their eyes,
and you know their future. If it's an inanimate object, you've got to get the
camera.  If it's an electrical socket, you see that they're going to put their
finger in it -- you intervene. If it's an animal, you do a threat model. Is the
cat cute or will it scratch the kid's face off? By putting the data in the
corporate cloud, we are that kid. We are giving corporations and governments
a way to see what we are looking towards, and they can predict our future. 


The best options for cloud are not open source, and the cost is giving up all
of our data. We are addicted to phones that track us 24/7 and know everything
we do. Idiots -- and you can quote me on that -- continue to buy home
surveillance-ware and hardware... so we are trending in all the wrong
directions. We should be fighting hard to not have our data in the control of
governments.

If you want to talk about impact stories for non-profit and civil society, you
need to understand what is at risk and stand in solidarity with those
who are practicing data minimalism and data solidarity. 

### K: Where are the biggest gaps in data solidarity? 

A complete understanding of the social graph we carry with us is still a huge
one that people still don't fully get. Data solidarity means how my social
graph toxifies other people's social graphs, and puts them in danger. For
example, I hosted Freedom of the Press, Edward Snowden's organization, we've
hosted Tor meetings, and other similar groups. If I make a clear social graph
connection with someone from a marginalized community, am I putting them at
risk? If suddenly the government wants to trace my social graph and incriminate
anyone I had collaborated with, that would be really bad for them. The unknown
future costs of data can not be calculated.

So for everyone out there, that means having good data retention policies,
e.g., do you save participant lists from your events forever? Many people talk
about the ways we might start correlating data practices with carbon practices?
In the same way that carbon in the atmosphere is going to kill us, data in the
digital sphere is going to kill us. DKG says another way to think about data is
to think about pesticides. As soon as they're utilized, we don't know the
future harm they could cause. The more data we let get collected the more
future harm we know that is possible -- so try to collect as little data as
possible.

Following this, Google Drive accounts are honey pots. A cellphone with
Signal on it without disappearing messages is a honey pot. Increasing our
resillience against data seisure means reducing the number of honey pots.
Although not yet an impact story, Next Cloud is part of that, it is encrypted
and has the right way to provide these guarantees. There are also a variety of
second-order Signal applications.. for example, signalboost.info. It uses the
signal protocol to do mass notifications for things like protests. It scrapes
all metadata, all numbers in the group are not visible to the recipients. The
owner of the Twilio account still knows all the phone numbers, but
it's a step in the right direction.

### K: As a leader in the non profit techology scene, you must have seen a wide
breadth of projects over the years. What projects have had the most impact that
are still active today?

Signal was and still is an emblem of a way to do technology in civil
society. It was a design-first project, that is the design came first and was
the most important thing to get right from the beginning. The goal was set so
that the user need know nothing about the security that protects them. They
combined this with a hugely talented staff and were able to do really well.
There are very few stories like this in civil society.

Wordpress, the open source content management system, is an example where we
have seen technology win in the sector. Wordpress is a paradigm for what the
open source ecosystem should be. It's open, but still sustainable. You have
options: you can do self-hosting where you control the data, have 3rd party
hosting where you can pay any joe to host your content, or pay the wordpress
team and get 100% uptime. Wordpress paired this 100% data exportability, which
means I can export my content any time and it's an open standard that easily
implements into other platforms. Even though it's not a non-profit platform,
it's an emblem of how opens ource should be done, which gives users a variety
of options for how they can control their own data. 


### K: For those reading this who are involved in non-profit technology; either
supporting an existing project or making a new one, do you have some advice?


### K: I'm sure there are many people reading this now who want to do something to help this movement against surveillance capital. What would you say to those who want to enter into this space?
