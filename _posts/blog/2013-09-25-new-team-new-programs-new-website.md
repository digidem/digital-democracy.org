title: "New team, new programs, new website"
---

The Dd team has been quiet lately, but we've been anything but idle. This year we have completed a three-year program, launched new initiatives  - and oh yeah, hosted Haiti's first hackathon. We've kept busy, learned a lot and had a great deal of fun along the way. 

New Site & New Staff
You may have noticed the new look of the Dd website. Both the design and the underlying philosophy are thanks to [Gregor MacLennan](http://www.digital-democracy.org/team/0001/01/02/gregor/), who joined our team as Program Director in February. Gregor comes to Dd with more than a decade of experience bringing new tools and technical training to marginalized communities in the Amazon. In addition to connections to indigenous groups and environmental activists in Latin America, Gregor brings to Dd a UK Passport (& Scottish Accent), West Coast presence (his home is now San Francisco) and equal parts passion for hardware hacking, redesigning websites in his sleep and traveling multiple days by boat to work directly with local communities. Get to know Gregor by checking out his [2011 Do Lecture talk](http://dolectures.com/lectures/how-technology-can-bare-witness/), and show him some love by reading & responding to his blog post on the [new Dd website](http://www.digital-democracy.org/blog/2013/09/25/our-new-website/).

Secondly, a warm welcome to Shahla Fatemi, who joined our team in May as a part-time Development & Communications Associate. In addition to infectious enthusiasm and passion for human rights (including prior work with Amnesty International and Falling Whistles) Shahla is a designer and jewelry maker. Her excitement about Dd's work and enjoyment of grant writing make her a great addition to the team. Read Shahla's blog post a weekend workshop Digital Democracy participated in with Design Gym this summer, focused on design thinking & strategic planning. 

Finally, we want to extend our deep gratitude to Liz Hodes and Biz Ghormley. Although they transitioned out of day-to-day operations earlier this year, their irreplacable spirit lives on in the organization, and we're glad to still call on them as friends and advisors to Dd.

New Programs
In February, we ended a three-year program focused on leveraging technology to address gender-based violence in Haiti. We ended the program with a bang, hosting an inspiring & fast paced-hackathin in Port-au-Prince that has now been replicated by local tech students. By the end of the month, we fully transitioned the technical and managerial tasks to the hands of our partner, Haitian women's organization KOFAVIV. This fall we're releasing our report on our work in Haiti, alongside recommendations for incorporating
