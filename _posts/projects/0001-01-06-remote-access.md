Oil contamination, illegal land grabs, forced labor. Remote communities in environmentally sensitive locations face these and other pressing threats to their land rights, natural resources and way of life. Often “off the grid,” these communities are unable to ensure equal footing in negotiations about their lives and land. Dd is partnering with groups in Chiapas, Mexico and the Amazon basin to build a mobile reporting platform for remote and indigenous communities.

By adapting open-source tools, Dd and its partners will create a reporter’s “Swiss Army Knife” that allows communities to document environmental degradation and government threats, map their use of the land, and engage with a global audience using mobile technology.

**Projected Impact:**  
Remote Access will not only enable our partners to share their stories, but also catalyze international stakeholders against exploitation.
