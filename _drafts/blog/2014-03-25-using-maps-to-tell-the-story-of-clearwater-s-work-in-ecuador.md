The Dd team is excited to announce the launch of a site we've been working on for months: An interactive map-based platform that tells the inspiring story of the ClearWater Project, an indigenous-led effort in Ecuador's northern Amazon region to bring clean water to thousands of people suffering from water contaminated by oil drilling. http://www.giveclearwater.org/map/

We partnered with ClearWater to build a new kind of map-based website, one where the narrative is central 
(why did we build the map, what makes it special) 

ClearWater isn't just bringing clean water catchment systems to communities in need. They are taking a holistic approach to supporting community development, building local capacity both in water engineering as well as technical skills like taking GPS and photos of contaminated areas, and training young people in new media skills to report from their communities. We are particularly thrilled to work on the site because it represented an opportunity to think creatively
