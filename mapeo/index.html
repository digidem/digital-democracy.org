      <h4>Create and edit maps together - all offline.</h4>
      <p>
        Mapeo is an easy-to-use offline mapping app designed to be used where internet
        is unreliable yet teams need to make maps together. The internet is never required.

      <h4>A mapping tool from a community of pros.</h4>
      <p>
        Mapeo is built on top of osm-p2p, a peer-to-peer database from OpenStreetMaps. Excellent work done by
        the iD contributors significantly lowers the barrier for a non-technical user to use a GPS and
        put their neighborhood on the map.

      <p>
        Built for and with indigenous communities in the Amazon and around the world, who asked us
        for an easier way to create and edit their own maps so as to defend their land and cultures.
