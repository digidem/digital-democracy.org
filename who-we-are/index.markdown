In 2008, we formed Digital Democracy (Dd) based on a simple but powerful idea: Technology should be used to empower even the most marginalized groups to engage in democratic action, whether locally, on a national or international scale. We are an independent non-profit 501c3 organization registered in New York.

**Mission**: Empower marginalized communities to use technology to fight for their human rights.

**Vision**: Continue our work using technology to encourage democratic engagement, protect human rights and empower marginalized voices globally.

**Theory of Change**: We believe change does not come from technology, but from how people use it.** **Our programs focus on a cycle we have identified: digital literacy, digital organizing and digital governance link to catalyze a 21st century “digital democracy.”
