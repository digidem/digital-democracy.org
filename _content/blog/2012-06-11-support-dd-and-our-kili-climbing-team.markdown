A team of Dd supporters will climb Mt. Kilimanjaro in July... and to prepare they are raising funds and awareness about Dd.

Digital Democracy is proud to shout out the team of mountaineers Dd supporters Dan Fredinburg, Sara Pelosi, Michele Battelli, Andrew Swerdlow, Sam Gilbert, Lindsey Smart and Megan Ezell, who have committed to fundraise for Digital Democracy as they prepare to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro in early July. But they can’t do this without [your help](http://www.crowdrise.com/kilifordd/fundraiser/digitaldemocracy)... If you can help them raise $5,000, your donation will be matched!

This team of technologists and adventurers are an impressive bunch – five of them currently work for Google, Sara has climbed Everest with Dan, Lindsey and Andrew before, and Megan is a high school student inspired to change the world. They are inventors, security and privacy specialists, skilled relationship and team builders, and they are fun.

Next month, the group will climb Africa’s tallest mountain with one goal: to raise $10,000 that will help support our projects to empower marginalized communities to leverage technology to fight for their human rights. These funds will go directly towards our work across the globe; from [our program in Haiti](http://www.slideshare.net/digidem/haiti-slide-deck-16may2012) to [our recent work in Chiapas, Mexico](http://digital-democracy.org/2012/05/25/reporting-back-from-chiapas-mexico/), Digital Democracy is working to use technology to fight rape, defend human rights, circumvent censorship, and change lives for the better. Support the Kili team today to help us continue to do our work around the globe!

While individual contributions represent only one kind of funding for our organization, your donations are what make our work with communities around the world possible. Please donate to the ‘Climb Kili’ team as they prepare for the climb of a lifetime.
