<!-- *************
To explain a little what is going on here...
Projects are have a tag "large", "medium" or "small".
We want to build a tiled layout for the first:
2 large projects, 1 medium project, 2 small projects.
We loop over the projects collection 3 times for each
project size, spitting out the first 1-2 posts we find.
We build an array (featured_posts) from a comma separated
string, to keep note of which posts we have already
rendered. Then, we loop through the posts again and
render any that have not already been rendered.
A few tricks:
1. There is no way to create an array other than splitting a string.
2. I convert a string to a number with the | times: 1 filter
3. The array of index numbers is actually strings (there is no
way to "push" a value to an array in liquid) so we need to convert
the forloop index to a string to compare it.
4. I convert a number to a string with | append: "".
