Jan nou wè l/The Way We See It is a powerful collection of 47 original photographs taken over the last year with donated cameras by more than 30 Haitian women who have been victims of gender-based violence. The collection reflects a year of photography work with Digital Democracy and the photographs capture the women’s post-earthquake reality: tarpaulin shelters, makeshift bathrooms and kitchens. In short, a world with few doors to lock in which no one has private space.

The Way We See It allows the world to view Haiti through an as-of-yet unseen perspective: the eyes of Haitian women living in Haiti today. All proceeds from sales of the photos and the corresponding catalog will directly benefit the women who took the photos, and the continued work of Digital Democracy.
