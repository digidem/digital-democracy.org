“In Burma, the obstacle is information – people inside the country need information,  
and they aren’t getting it.” – University student, 2007

![alt][2]Although recently transitioned to civilian rule, for close to 50 years Burma/Myanmar was strictly controlled by a ruling military junta. During its tenure, the government crushed peaceful protests and barred public gatherings of more than 5 people without official permission. Escaping ethnic violence, forced labor and political incarceration, millions have fled the country and live as refugees. Since 2008, Dd has worked with people across the spectrum within the country and along the borders in Thailand, India, Bangladesh, and China to amplify diverse voices. Collaborating with Burmese students and technologists, as well as religious and social leaders, Dd has helped drive international awareness about the complex realities in the country, and support efforts to reduce human rights violations and encourage more participation.

**Community Partners:  
**ABITSU (All Burma IT Student Union)  
ABMA (All Burma Monks Alliance)  
BIT (Burma Information Technology Team)

**Co-created Solutions:**

*   **TECH CONVENINGS:** Advised on launch strategy for BarCamp Yangon, a user-generated conference uniting technologists, entrepreneurs and activists to brainstorm how technology and media can influence the struggle for democracy. Over 5,000 people attended the 2012 event, hosted by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
*   **MAPPING:** Built Handheld Human Rights, an online tool that streamlines communications among organizations and tracks and disseminate details of human rights violations. To date, more than a decade of human rights documentation has been aggregated and made publicly available via the online map and visualization tool.
*   **MEDIA:** Initiated Project Einstein, in which refugee youth in over ten countries – including Bangladesh, South Africa, Kazakhstan and the United States – have received hands-on training in digital photography and have shared their experiences via exhibitions, books and digital-pen pals. Dd published a free manual, available in three languages, which can be used by other organizations to implement Project Einstein curriculum into their advocacy work.

**Impact:** Dd trainings and events have helped our partners enhance security, organize more effectively, and build bridges to the population in diaspora. Perspectives, voices and data have been shared across borders and from refugee camps, empowering activists making the world a witness to their work for peace.
