Founded on the belief that technology should be used to bring more voices to the table, Digital Democracy helps our **partners** achieve **transformative change** and works toward a world where **all people can participate** in decisions that govern their lives.

Working at the intersection of human rights and technology, Dd pairs local leaders with strategic use of tools to catalyze community-driven solutions.

Our process is both technology and issue agnostic – that is, not bound to one platform or cause. We recognize that our partners’ issues are diverse, but many of the challenges they face are shared. Using a listening-based, human-centered design process, Dd helps to strengthen our partners’ access, communication, resources and reach.

Equipped with the tools they need, our partners are becoming better storytellers, advocates and leaders. Together, Dd and its partners are empowering communities to become their own voice for change.

**Digital Democracy works in three ways:**

1.  **Direct Implementation:** We train communities to use basic digital tools, such as cameras, mobile phones, and online maps. Our tiered approach emphasizes digital literacy, digital organizing and digital governance.
2.  **Tool Building:** We create tech solutions to empower our partners and help them adapt existing tools to their needs. We also work with digital innovators to develop and implement new open-source tools.
3.  **Local-to-Global Engagement:** We scale our impact beyond our direct partners. Through events, workshops, and tool-kits, we build bridges between our work and the work of advocates and decision-makers around the world.
