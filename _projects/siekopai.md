The Siekopai people were displaced from their ancestral territory, known as
Lagarto Cocha, in the 1940s due to a border conflict between Peru and Ecuador.
This war divided their families and their culture in two for over sixty years,
with many forced upriver into Ecuador and others down into Peru. The Siekopai
in Ecuador now live a dayâ€™s travel upriver, along the Aguarico river, an area
with a very different ecosystem and hemmed in on all sides by the social and
environmental impacts of oil operations and industrial agriculture. Only in the
last couple of decades has the border region been largely demilitarized and the
Siekopai been allowed back to visit.  

This area, full of flooded forests and black water lakes is believed to be
where the Siekopai people originated, and many myths and stories are located
there. Recently they have started a project to reconnect the new generations
with their ancestral heartland, travelling back to Lagarto Cocha a few times
a year to hunt, fish, practice sacred ceremonies and collect some of the
special resources found there which are central to their culture. Part of this
project involved making a map of the river Lagarto, the many lakes which fringe
it, the sites of old villages, ceremonial sites and the paths taken by their
ancestors, and they approached Digital Democracy in 2015 to help them think
through their methodology.


**Community partners:**

Dd worked closely with the Siekopai territory team of
Alianza Ceibo, with community members working on the project, and staff
from Amazon Frontlines supporting. 

**Co-created solutions:**

The Dd team trained a group of ten young Siekopai to use
Mapeo to trace the outlines of the many lakes, using an offline satellite image
as a guide, which they could do in their villages with community members
looking on. They then visited the area with their elders and recorded the names
and stories of each lake and important place. This map was added to with GPS
points taken at the sites of old villages, which they identified through oral
histories, and ancestral paths connecting river basins and villages. 

**Impact:**

The use of technology has given the young people involved a concrete
role in this process of reconnection, helping them engage with and make theirs
an area they had only ever heard about in stories from their grandparents. The
process was accompanied by the territory and communications teams of Alianza
Ceibo and Amazon Frontlines, who supported them to make videos explaining the
history behind each site. Digital Democracy worked with these teams to produce
an interactive map, in Siekopai, Spanish and English, on which Lagarto Cocha,
and their stories and testimonies can be explored.
