Digital Democracy is looking for an Executive Assistant to join our small, agile team, based in the Bay Area, California. The Executive Assistant will work directly with the Executive Director to support her role overseeing all aspects of the organization’s work, including fundraising, communications, operations.

Together, the Digital Democracy team works to support frontline communities and collaborate with them to build cutting-edge open source tools to document, map, monitor, manage and report information on environmental and human rights issues around the world.

At Digital Democracy, we’ve seen firsthand that **change does not come from technology, but from how people use it**. We are building tools our partners are using to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern their lives. Equipped with the tools they need, our partners are becoming more effective storytellers, advocates, and leaders.

    * Emails
    * Day-to-day scheduling
    * Travel logistics
    * Invited appearances

    * Booking travel
    * Staying apprised of the team’s travel schedule
    * Organizing team meetings

## Qualities we’re on the lookout for

* A **detail-oriented planner** who appreciates and supports working with an abstract big picture thinker
* A **clear communicator** adept at correspondence and scheduling
* **Focused on people**. A listening-based, human-centered process is at the heart of everything we do. We’re looking for someone with excellent people skills and excitement to get to know our various partners, collaborators, and supporters.
* **Desire to change the world**. Our work is focused on supporting marginalized communities to control their own futures and make a difference addressing threats like deforestation and human rights abuses.
* **Team Player** comfortable working with a small team and jumping in to help where needed.
* **Hablas español**. You speak multiple languages, especially Spanish. Not a requirement, but a plus for communicating with our partners.

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is mainly based in the Bay Area, California, but includes staff members based around the world.

The indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and are dealing with its long term consequences everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their languages and cultures. We are building a team from diverse backgrounds that can understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply.

We are an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Perks

* **Flexible schedule, location, and hours**. As an organization we embrace working smarter, not harder.
* Opportunity to **participate in site visits with our partners in the field.**
* Opportunity to **be part of a small, supportive team at a ground-breaking organization**. You have the opportunity to make a big impact on a small team.
* **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience.** We are initially looking for a part-time person with the opportunity to grow into a full-time role.
