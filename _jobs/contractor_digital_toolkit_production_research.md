# Contractor, Digital Toolkit Production & Research

## What we’re looking for

Digital Democracy is looking for a **Contractor, Digital Toolkit Production & Research** for a 2-month part-time contract starting as soon as possible. You will work in tandem with a project manager to expand the existing collection of visual guides for the [Earth Defenders Toolkit](http://earthdefenderstoolkit.com), based on existing research notes and executing supplementary interviews with Digital Democracy staff. We are looking for somebody with good research skills as well as a penchant for user-friendly design. The Earth Defenders Toolkit serves Indigenous and other local communities that may have limited experience working with technology, and therefore putting together streamlined, well thought out, and elegant guides without an excess of information or text are key to success.

## The Project

Digital Democracy has already identified the themes for each guide and conducted research on the subject. Your job will be to use this research (and conduct any supplementary interviews, if needed) to finalize written content. You will create five (5) visually stimulating pedagogical guides on the subject of data security and data sovereignty for an audience of Indigenous and other remote communities.  Using existing design guidelines and templates, and applying finesse and a designer’s eye, you will be responsible for all finishing touches to these five guides. Examples of existing guides (featured tool pages, case studies, and practical guides) can be found on the Earth Defenders Toolkit website.

## The Context

The Earth Defenders Toolkit is a collaborative space for earth defenders and their allies. The Toolkit provides a growing collection of resources and training materials for communities on the frontlines of the struggle to defend critical ecosystems around the world, and community networks for users to connect and share their experiences.

We’ve seen firsthand that **change does not come from technology, but from how people use it.** The Earth Defenders Toolkit goal is to help communities explore how they might use available tools. We are building tools our partners are using to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern their lives.

## The Role

* With guidance from the Earth Defenders Toolkit project manager, conduct overview research on the subject matter of data security and data sovereignty.
* Consult existing research notes compiled for the five guides.
* Devise an outline of the content for the five guides, and identify any gaps of information.
* Conduct additional research or interviews with Digital Democracy staff to gather additional information needed.
* Compile written content for the guides and share with Earth Defenders Toolkit project manager for several rounds of feedback and iteration.
* Compile drafts of the visual guides to share with Earth Defenders Toolkit team for several rounds of feedback and iteration.
* Create final versions of the guides in PDF format and share Design files with Earth Defenders Toolkit project manager for translation to other languages.

## Qualities we’re on the lookout for

* **Values-based.** You share our belief in building tools that prioritize the self-determination and autonomy of our partners, and challenge legacies of colonization and extraction.
* **Ability to distill.** There is an abundance of information on the subject of the guides, and we are looking for somebody that can summarize and distill this information into a user-friendly guide for community members.
* **Zeal for visual design.** Where possible, we use visual layouts and designs for the assets published to the Earth Defenders Toolkit to help communicate the information. We are keen to find somebody that has a creative penchant for visualizing information in an attractive layout. Graphics and illustration experience are not required as we do have a library of assets to work with, but definitely a plus.

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in Brazil, Canada, Peru, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. The Indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture. It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with individuals who understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Compensation

Compensation is a flat fee of $5,000 USD for the completion of the deliverables listed above. The contract entails flexible hours and opportunity to work where and when best fits your schedule.

## How to Apply

Send a note with the following to [rkemper@digital-democracy.org](mailto:rkemper@digital-democracy.org). We will review applications as we receive them.

* Why are you interested in developing guides for the Earth Defenders Toolkit.
* Portfolio and/or examples of your work. Link to projects you’ve finished, and in particular any visual documents that you’ve compiled.
