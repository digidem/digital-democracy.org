Digital Democracy is looking for a backend developer with 5 years experience to join our small, remote team on a 6-month contract (with potential long-term) starting as soon as possible. You will help build offline-first decentralized open-source mobile and desktop mapping apps for remote and marginalized communities to document, map, monitor, manage and report information on environmental and human rights issues around the world. With flexible hours and the opportunity to work where and when best fits your schedule, you will be playing a key role at a ground-breaking organization. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a small team by contributing to the revamp and redesign of our backend modules.

We’ve seen firsthand that change does not come from technology, but from how people use it. We are building tools our partners are using to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern their lives.

What we're looking for
----------------------

You will work with our growing, small high-impact team of engineers, a designer, and a product manager to lead the development of the peer-to-peer database that powers our mobile and desktop mapping apps. You will work closely with the front-end team to build backend features to meet user requirements on a regular release cycle.

Our team takes a collaborative approach to tool-building and decision-making with our partner communities. You would be building tools that will be tested and used by our partners to confront real problems on the ground in the Amazon and around the world: Protection of the world’s forests and their ancestral homelands from deforestation and contamination. We need someone who can think creatively and collaboratively to solve these problems.

The Role
--------

- Work closely with our Senior Backend Developer who is leading the development of the new Mapeo Core architecture.
- Implement key modules for the Mapeo Core database and p2p networking
Revamp and redesign of our backend modules using Hypercore.
- Coordinate with our front end developers to design usable data models for UI.
- Maintain and contribute to several open-source modules used by Digital Democracy
- You’re comfortable working with a small team and jumping in to help where needed.


Important traits for this role
------------------------------

- **Peer-to-peer**. You have an understanding of peer-to-peer data structures and networking, and have ideally worked on p2p projects in the past.
- **Tooling knowledge**. Node.js; modular code; Typescript; Git; SQLite — you are comfortable and proficient working with these.
- **Values-based**. You share our belief in building tools that prioritize the autonomy of our partners, and challenge legacies of colonialism and extraction.
- **Rigorous at testing**. You can write thorough automated tests that cover usage of the code in a real environment.
- **BST + PDT timezone compatible**. You can intersect your working day for at least 1 hour with BST and PDT.
- **API design & documentation**. You are capable of designing a simple and easy-to-understand API and clearly documenting and communicating the code.

Other qualities we're on the lookout for
----------------------------------------

- Experience working within an Agile environment
- Experience with Hypercore Protocol
- Enthusiasm for open-source and experience publishing and maintaining modules
- Proficiency in TypeScript
- Experience working with geospatial data (not required)
- Knowledge working with Android apps (not required)

Benefits
----------------------------------------

- 4-day week. We consider “full time” to be a 4-day week (8 hours per day).
Flexible schedule, location and hours. As an organization we embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work from where you live, on a schedule that works for you.
- Opportunity to visit our partners in the field. Although most of the job is desk based, this role may include travel to our partner communities for workshops if you continue working with us long-term beyond the current pandemic.
- Opportunity to play a key role at a ground-breaking organization. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a small team.
Compensation commensurate with experience. $6,000—$7,500 USD per month (for a 4-day week).

Our Team
--------

Our small but growing team is based in Montreal & Squamish, Canada; New York, DC Metro Area & Washington State, USA; Barcelona, Spain; Goiás, Brazil; Lima, Peru; Hastings & Edinburgh, U.K. and we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. The Indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture. It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with individuals who understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
