## About the Organization

Digital Democracy’s mission is to empower marginalized communities to use technology to defend their rights. We envision a healthy, vibrant planet where all people have a voice in the decisions that impact their lives. Through our programs, we partner directly with grassroots organizations to build their technical capacity, and support their responses to local problems. We collaborate with our local partners to build cutting-edge open source tools to empower communities in remote places to monitor, document and speak out about environmental and human rights abuses. We are piloting our platform, Mapeo, with indigenous groups in the Amazon rainforest. Mapeo is an offline tool for mapping and environmental monitoring. See our website for more.
