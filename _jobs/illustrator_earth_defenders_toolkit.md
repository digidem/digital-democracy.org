[Digital Democracy](https://www.digital-democracy.org/) (Dd) is a global non-profit that works in solidarity with marginalized communities to use technology to defend their human rights, protect the environment, and combat climate change. 

## The Role 

Dd is seeking an illustrator to join our small, remote team for a one month contract to help us develop the toolkit components and visual branding for an exciting new project called [Earth Defenders Toolkit](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/) (EDToolkit) that is launching in June 2021. 

EDToolkit is a collection of open-source, accessible tools and training materials for communities on the frontlines of the struggle to defend the world’s forests and critical ecosystems.

We are looking for an illustrator who can work closely with a small, fast-paced team and a contracted graphic designer to:

* Establish the artistic style for the toolkit, and ensure illustrations convey concepts
* Develop illustrations that will be used for toolkit, educational materials, and website
* Research and provide sketches for approval
* Develop final illustrations that are scalable

We are looking for someone who likes to work collaboratively and is excited about our mission. 

One month contract starting May 1, 2021. Compensation commensurate with experience, and to be determined together following a discussion of the deliverables. 

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in Oakland, CA; Washington, DC; New York; Montreal, Canada; Abuja, Nigeria; Barcelona, Spain; Goiás, Brazil; Hastings & Oxford, U.K. and we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. The Indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture. It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with individuals who understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## How to Apply

Send a note with the following to [info@digital-democracy.org](mailto:info@digital-democracy.org) by Sunday, April 25th.
