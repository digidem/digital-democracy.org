## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in the US (New York; Seattle; Washington, DC; Wisconsin); Brazil; Canada (British Columbia & Montreal) and Europe (Catalonia; England & Scotland). For this position, we are looking for a US-based person to join our team as a full-time employee.  We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. The Indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their languages and cultures. It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with individuals who understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Perks

* 4-day work week. We consider “full time” to be 32 hours per week. Some people work 8-hour days, and others distribute their hours organically across the week.
* Flexible schedule, location and hours. As an organization we embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work from where you live, on a schedule that works for you.
* Opportunity to travel internationally and to visit our partners in the field. Although most of the job is desk based, this role may include travel to visit our partners and to get together with the team. You will play a key role in planning a team retreat in Ecuador in 2023. 
* Opportunity to play a key role at a ground-breaking organization. You have the opportunity to make a big impact on a small team.
* Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience. We have a transparent pay scale in our organization, with starting rates of $60,000 and increases based on responsibilities and experience. We expect this position’s salary range to be between $70-80,000/year plus benefits.
