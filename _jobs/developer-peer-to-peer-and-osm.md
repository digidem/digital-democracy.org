Digital Democracy is looking a full- or part-time developer for 3–6 months to prototype an OpenStreetMap server stack and database that allow distributed teams in low-connectivity environments to collaborate on private maps using easy-to-learn OpenStreetMap tools such as iDEditor.

Maps are a powerful tool for the communities we work with in the Amazon Rainforest to document why the forests and rivers around them are important to their livelihoods and identity, and to help communicate the threats to their way of life from proposed oil, mining and forestry projects. At Digital Democracy we are developing technology that empowers communities, involves them in all stages of mapping, and gives them more access to and control over information about the world around them. We’re excited about how OpenStreetMap tools allow for collaboration and lower the entry point for people to begin mapping the world around them.

We are looking for a developer who can understand the OpenStreetMap server stack and data model and experiment with ways it can be adapted for working in offline and distributed environments. Our ideas include simplifying the server stack to make it easier to install locally on a Raspberry Pi or on the local machine, and looking at adapting the OSM data model to allow for peer-to-peer syncing.

If you are excited about peer-to-peer technology, de-centralized systems, and if words like scuttlebutt and vector clocks and replicable data structures mean something to you and excite you, then we’d love to hear from you. We are looking for someone who can think outside the box: do we even need to use a database? Or would a system of static files like Jekyll for maps server our needs? Everything we do is done in the open and is open source, and our goal is that the tools we build will have applications far beyond the communities we work with and in ways we have not yet thought of.

###Apply if:

- You know and love javascript, not just jQuery.

- You've wondered how the internet could work without central servers in the cloud storing all the data.

- You've taken a peek into the inner workings of OpenStreetMap.

- You navigate Github and git like a pro, and diligently document your code and commits.

- You share our values, wanting to make a difference in the world working at a mission-driven organization. You believe solutions lie in listening to and working with and for local communities.

- You’re comfortable taking your own initiative working in a small team.

###Qualities we’re on the lookout for

- **Love of code**. Elegance is important to you, you spend time finding the simple, smarter solution rather than the complex, long way round. You value testing and creating reliable, maintainable code.

- **Interest in distributed systems**. You’ve heard of PouchDB, LevelUp, Scuttlebutt, BitTorrent, block chains, DAT and you are interesting in exploring how different distributed data models can work for mapping and collaboration in remote offline environments.

- **OSM geeks**. You will need to understand some of the inner-workings of OpenStreetMaps and understand what a node, way and relationship is in the OSM world, and how existing changesets and merging works.

- **Zeal for open source**. We have over [40 repositories on Github](https://github.com/digidem) and believe in building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.

- **Enthusiasm for design**. A listen-based, human-centered design process is at the heart of everything we do. The tools you build need to be easy to use for smart, fast learners who have maybe never touched a computer or smartphone before.


### Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in the Bay Area, California, but we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. Women and people of color strongly urged to apply. You will be reporting to the Program Director.

###How to apply

Send a note with the following to jobs@digital-democracy.org

- Why you’re interested in developing code at Digital Democracy.

- Résumé.

- Examples of your work. Link to your GitHub page, to projects you’ve finished, or to your website.

- (Extra points) a story of your experience working with advocacy groups locally or internationally, or travel which has changed your perception of the world.
