Digital Democracy is looking for a front-end developer with 5+ years of
developer experience to join our small, remote team on a 6-month contract (with
potential long-term) starting as soon as possible. You will help build
cutting-edge open-source mobile and desktop mapping apps for remote and
marginalized communities to document, map, monitor, manage and report
information on environmental and human rights issues around the world.

We've seen firsthand that **change does not come from technology, but
from how people use it**. We are building tools our partners are using
to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a
world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern
their lives.

## What we're looking for

You will work with our growing, small team of four engineers and
designers to build new features and fix bugs in a desktop app written in
React/Electron and a mobile app written in React Native. You have 5+
years experience building on the web or Electron using HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. You have proficiency in React, and are comfortable using git
for collaboration. You will work with a designer and field-staff to
incorporate user feedback to turn designs into reality. You will also
work on one-off projects such as interactive story maps, our website,
and online user manuals.

We are a small, high-impact team that takes a collaborative approach to
tool-building and decision-making. Our tool development is led by our
partner communities. You would be building tools that will be tested and
used by our partners to confront real problems on the ground in the
Amazon and around the world: Protection of the world's forests and their
ancestral homelands from deforestation and contamination. We need
someone who can think creatively and collaboratively to solve these
problems.

This can be a part-time or full-time position of 20-40 hours per week
(negotiable).

## The Role

- Develop new features and bug fixes for an existing React Native
mobile app and React/Electron desktop app for offline mapping,
monitoring and storytelling.

- Coordinate with our designer to implement designs and user
interaction.

- Coordinate with our peer-to-peer database developer to integrate
with the backend.

- You're comfortable working with a small team and jumping in to help
where needed.

## Qualities we're on the lookout for

- **Love of code**. You love a challenge, value testing, and create
reliable, maintainable code.

- **Values-based**. You share our belief in building tools that
prioritize the self-determination and autonomy of our partners,
and challenge legacies of colonization and extraction.

- **Enthusiasm for open source**. We have over 100 repositories on
Github and believe in building open tools that others can
contribute to and build upon.

- **Self-directed**. You are comfortable with managing your own
priorities and tasks in coordination with a small, remote team.

- **Zeal for design**. A listen-based, human-centered design process
is at the heart of our work. The tools you build need to be
accessible and easy-to-use for smart, fast learners who have maybe
never touched a computer or smartphone before.

- **Hablas español**. You speak more than one language, ideally
Spanish. Not a requirement, but a plus for communicating with our
end-users.

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in Oakland, CA; Washington, DC; New
York; Montreal, Canada; Abuja, Nigeria; London & Oxford, U.K. and we
welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We
embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where
you live. The indigenous communities we work with have lived through
colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with
marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture.
It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with
individuals who understand and empathize with their situation.
Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who
identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to
apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do
not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin,
gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or
disability status.

## Perks

- **Flexible schedule, location and hours**. As an organization we
embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work
from where you live, on a schedule that works for you.

- Opportunity to **visit our partners in the field**. Although most of
the job is desk based, this role may include travel to our partner
communities for workshops if you continue working with us
long-term beyond the current pandemic.

- Opportunity to **play a key role at a ground-breaking
organization**. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a
small team.

- **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience** (our
current range is $6,000--8,000 USD per month full-time
equivalent), with flexible hours and opportunity to work where and
when best fits your schedule.

## How to Apply

Send a note with the following to
[jobs@digital-democracy.org](mailto:jobs@digital-democracy.org).
We will review applications as we receive them.

- Why you're interested in developing tools at Digital Democracy.

- *Résumé* / CV

- Examples of your work. Link to projects you've finished and any open
source work on Github.

- (Extra points) a story of an experience in work, travel or
volunteering that has changed your perception of the world.
