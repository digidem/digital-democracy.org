Digital Democracy is looking for a lead front-end developer with 5+ years of
developer experience to join our small, remote team on a 12-month contract (with
potential long-term) starting as soon as possible. See also our [Front-end
Developer
role](/jobs/2021-02-front-end-developer/). You
will lead the development of a cutting-edge open-source mobile and desktop
mapping app for remote and marginalized communities to document, map, monitor,
manage and report information on environmental and human rights issues around
the world.

We've seen firsthand that **change does not come from technology, but
from how people use it**. We are building tools our partners are using
to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a
world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern
their lives.

What we're looking for
----------------------

You will work with our growing, small team of four engineers and
designers to build new features and fix bugs in a desktop app written in
React/Electron and a mobile app written in React Native. You have 5+
years experience working in a team to develop and deploy apps and have
experience with React, Electron and/or React Native. You have
proficiency in Javascript, and are comfortable using git for
collaboration. You will work closely with our Product Manager and Tech
Director to lead our front-end development.

We are a small, high-impact team that takes a collaborative approach to
tool-building and decision-making. Our tool development is led by our
partner communities. You would be building tools that will be tested and
used by our partners to confront real problems on the ground in the
Amazon and around the world: Protection of the world's forests and their
ancestral homelands from deforestation and contamination. We need
someone who can think creatively and collaboratively to solve these
problems.

This can be a part-time or full-time position of 20-40 hours per week
(negotiable).

The Role
--------

- Develop new features and bug fixes for an existing React Native mobile app and React/Electron desktop app for offline mapping, monitoring and storytelling.
- Coordinate with our designer to implement designs and user interaction.
- Coordinate with our peer-to-peer database developer to integrate with the backend.
- Work with a small team and jumping in to help where needed.
- Learn and help define future Mapeo features with the Product Manager

Important traits for this role
------------------------------

- **Love of code**. You love a challenge, value testing, and create maintainable code.
- **Values-based**. You share our belief in building tools that prioritize the autonomy of our partners, and challenge legacies of colonialism and extraction.
- **Enthusiasm for open source**. We have over 100 repositories on Github and believe in building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.
- **Self-directed**. You are comfortable with managing your own priorities and tasks in coordination with a small, remote team.
- **Zeal for design**. A listen-based, human-centered design process is at the heart of our work. The tools you build need to be accessible and easy-to-use for smart, fast learners who have maybe never touched a computer or smartphone before.
- **A no-ego approach** and a willingness to learn and grow the team.
- **Experience working with a team** (Product Manager, UX Designer and tech team) to plan, prioritize, build, and deploy code.

Other qualities we're on the lookout for
----------------------------------------

- Experience working within an Agile environment
- Ability to communicate technical concepts to the team and partners in non-technical terms.
- Ability to speak more than one language, in particular Spanish or Portuguese

Our Team
--------

Our small but growing team is based in Oakland, CA; Washington, DC; New
York; Montreal, Canada; Abuja, Nigeria; Barcelona, Spain; Goiás, Brazil;
Hastings & Oxford, U.K. and we welcome candidates from around the world,
especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy
for you to work from where you live. The Indigenous communities we work
with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday,
along with marginalization and discrimination against their language and
culture. It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse
team with individuals who understand and empathize with their situation.
Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who
identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to
apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do
not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin,
gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or
disability status.

Perks
-----

- **Flexible schedule, location and hours**. As an organization we embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work from where you live, on a schedule that works for you.
- Opportunity to **visit our partners in the field**. Although most of the job is desk based, this role may include travel to our partner communities for workshops if you continue working with us long-term beyond the current pandemic.
- Opportunity to **play a key role at a ground-breaking organization**. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a small team.
- **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience** (the salary range of our current staff is $6,000--8,000 USD per month full-time equivalent), with flexible hours and opportunity to work where and when best fits your schedule.

How to Apply
------------

Send a note with the following to [jobs+ld02@digital-democracy.org](mailto:jobs+ld02@digital-democracy.org) by March 25th 2021. We will review applications as we receive them.

- *Résumé* / CV
- Examples of your work. Link to projects you've finished and any open source work on Github.
- (Extra points) a story of an experience in work, travel or volunteering that has changed your perception of the world.
