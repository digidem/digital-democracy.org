Digital Democracy is looking for a React Native Android developer to join our small, agile team for a 9-month contract starting in November 2017. You will help build cutting-edge open source mobile mapping app for remote and marginalized communities to document, map, monitor, manage and report information on environmental and human rights issues around the world.

We’ve seen firsthand that **change does not come from technology, but from how people use it**. We are building tools our partners are using to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern their lives.

## What we’re looking for

You will lead the front-end development work on a React Native app, initially targeting Android, for mapping and field reporting, to be used by indigenous communities worldwide. You have experience developing a React and/or React Native app, proficiency in using git and other collaboration tools,  are comfortable working with a designer to incorporate user feedback to turn designs into reality.

We are a small, high-impact team that takes a collaborative approach to tool-building and decision-making. Our tool development is led by our partner communities. As a developer you would be building tools that will be tested and used by our partners to confront real problems on the ground: Protection of the world’s forests and their ancestral homelands from deforestation and contamination. We need someone who can think creatively to solve these problems.

This can be a part-time or full-time position of 20-40 hours per week (negotiable).

## The Role

* Develop a React Native app for offline mapping, monitoring and storytelling.

* Integrate react-native-mapbox-gl for interactive maps.

* Coordinate with our designer to implement the design and user interaction.

* Coordinate with our peer-to-peer database developer to integrate the p2p backend.

* You’re comfortable working with a small team and jumping in to help where needed.

## Qualities we’re on the lookout for

* **Love of code.** You love a challenge, value testing, and create reliable, maintainable code.

* **Interest in offline and distributed systems.** Our tools need to work offline and synchronize without a central server.

* **Values based.** You share our belief in building tools that prioritize the self-determination and autonomy of our partners, and challenge legacies of colonization and extraction.

* **Zeal for open source**. We have over [100 repositories on Github](https://github.com/digidem) and believe in building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.

* **Passionate about maps**. Much of our work centers around making maps. You have experience building interactive maps and are familiar with[ OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) tools.

* **Enthusiasm for design**. A listen-based, human-centered design process is at the heart of everything we do. The tools you build need to be easy to use for smart, fast learners who have maybe never touched a computer or smartphone before.

* **Hablas español**. You speak more than one language, ideally Spanish. Not a requirement, but a plus for communicating with our end-users.

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in Oakland and LA, California; Edinburgh, Scotland; Vancouver, Canada, and we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. The indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture. It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with individuals who understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Perks

* **Flexible schedule, location and hours**. As an organization we embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work from where you live, on a schedule that works for you.

* Opportunity to **visit our partners in the field.** Although most of the job is desk based, this role may include travel to our partner communities for workshops, user testing and more.

* Opportunity to **play a key role at a ground-breaking organization**. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a small team.

* **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience**, with flexible hours and opportunity to work where and when best fits your schedule.

## How to apply

Send a note with the following to [jobs@digital-democracy.org](mailto:jobs@digital-democracy.org) **by November 10th**. We hope to hire by November 30th and will review applications as we receive them.

* Why you’re interested in developing tools at Digital Democracy.

* *Résumé* / CV

* Examples of your work. Link to projects you’ve finished and any open source work on Github.

* (Extra points) a story of an experience in work, travel or volunteering that has changed your perception of the world.
