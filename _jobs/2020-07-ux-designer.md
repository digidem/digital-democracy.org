Digital Democracy is looking for a full- or part-time User Experience
Designer to join our small, remote team on a 6-month contract (with
potential long-term) starting as soon as possible. You will help build
cutting-edge open-source mobile and desktop mapping apps for remote and
marginalized communities to document, map, monitor, manage and report
information on environmental and human rights issues around the world.

We've seen firsthand that **change does not come from technology, but
from how people use it**. We are building tools our partners are using
to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a
world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern
their lives.

## What we're looking for

You will lead our design work on desktop and mobile apps for mapping and
field reporting, to be used by indigenous communities worldwide. You are
enthusiastic about making complicated workflows simple and intuitive,
designing for users without technical experience. You have excellent
people skills and are able to work with our programs team to understand
user needs and requirements and turn them into wireframes and prototypes
for feedback, and work with the technical team to implement designs in
code. You will also work on one-off projects such as interactive story
maps, our website, and online user manuals.

We are a small, high-impact team that takes a collaborative approach to
tool-building and decision-making. Our tool development is led by our
partner communities. You would be building tools that will be tested and
used by our partners to confront real problems on the ground in the
Amazon and around the world: Protection of the world's forests and their
ancestral homelands from deforestation and contamination. We need
someone who can think creatively to solve these problems.

This can be a part-time or full-time position of 20-40 hours per week
(negotiable).

## The Role

- Work with our team & partners around the world, to understand what
communities need technology to do, and how current technology
creates barriers for them.

- Design wireframes, flows and screens for our mapping, monitoring and
storytelling tools on desktop and mobile.

- Work with our team to think through how to tell interactive stories
with maps and multimedia that help our partners tell their story
to the world.

- You have strong visual design skills and experience designing user
flows and interaction and preparing assets for a development team.

- You're comfortable working with a small team and jumping in to help
where needed.

## Qualities we're on the lookout for

- **Focus on people**. A listening-based, human-centered design
process is at the heart of everything we do. We're seeking
experience working with diverse communities.

- **Desire to change the world**. Our goal is that our tools help
marginalized communities control their own futures and make a
difference.

- **Values based**. You share our belief in building tools that
prioritize the self-determination and autonomy of our partners,
and challenge legacies of colonization and extraction.

- **Passionate about design**. Our goal is to create tools that a user
who has never used a phone or laptop before can pick it up and
understand how it works through good design, interactions and
animations.

- **Enthusiasm for open source**. We have over [[100 repositories on
Github]{.underline}](https://github.com/digidem) and believe in
building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.

- **Hablas español**. You speak more than one language, ideally
Spanish. Not a requirement, but a plus for communicating with our
end-users.

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in Oakland, CA; Washington, DC; New
York; Montreal, Canada; Abuja, Nigeria; London & Oxford, U.K. and we
welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We
embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where
you live. The indigenous communities we work with have lived through
colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with
marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture.
It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with
individuals who understand and empathize with their situation.
Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who
identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to
apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do
not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin,
gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or
disability status.

## Perks

- **Flexible schedule, location and hours**. As an organization we
embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work
from where you live, on a schedule that works for you.

- Opportunity to **visit our partners in the field**. Although most of
the job is desk based, this role may include travel to our partner
communities for workshops if you continue working with us
long-term beyond the current pandemic.

- Opportunity to **play a key role at a ground-breaking
organization**. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a
small team.

- **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience** (our
current range is $6,000--8,000 USD per month full-time
equivalent), with flexible hours and opportunity to work where and
when best fits your schedule.

## How to Apply

Send a note with the following by **9am UTC August 10th** to
[jobs@digital-democracy.org](mailto:jobs@digital-democracy.org).

- Why you're interested in developing tools at Digital Democracy.

- *Résumé* / CV

- Examples of your work and approach to design

- (Extra points) a story of an experience in work, travel or
volunteering that has changed your perception of the world.
