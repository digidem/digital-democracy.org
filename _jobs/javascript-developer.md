Digital Democracy is looking for a coder to join our small, agile team to build cutting-edge open source tools that marginalized communities around the world will use to document, map, monitor, manage and report information on environmental and human rights abuses.
We’ve seen firsthand that change does not come from technology, but from how people use it. We are building tools our partners will use to achieve transformative change and works toward a world where all people can participate in decisions that govern their lives. Equipped with the tools they need, our partners are becoming better storytellers, advocates and leaders.

We’re looking for a javascript developer full or part-time with experience building mobile apps with Cordova/PhoneGap and experience with frameworks like Backbone, Angular and Ember. Your main focus will be developing an offline mobile reporting platform our partners will use to document and monitor oil spills, gold mines and deforestation in Guyana, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil. As a small team, you’ll be jumping in to help with some of the other [open source server and client tools](https://github.com/digidem) we’re building in node/javascript.

###Qualities we’re looking for

- **Love of code**. Elegance is important to you, you spend time finding the simple, smarter solution rather than the complex, long way round. You value testing and creating reliable, maintainable code.

- **Shared values**. You want to make a difference in the world, working at a mission-driven organization with a small, passionate team who believes solutions lie in listening to and working with and for local communities.

- **Interest in distributed systems**. You know about PouchDB, LevelUp, Scuttlebot, BitTorrent. Our tools need to work offline and synchronize without a central server.

- **Zeal for open source**. We have over [40 repositories on Github](https://github.com/digidem) and believe in building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.

- **Passionate about maps**. A lot of our work centers around the empowerment of making a map and their power as a [storytelling tool](http://www.giveclearwater.org/map/). You have experience building interactive maps and using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) tools.

- **Enthusiasm for design**. A listen-based, human-centered design process is at the heart of everything we do. The tools you build need to be easy to use for smart, fast learners who have maybe never touched a computer or smartphone before.

- **Mobile experience**. We are developing mobile apps with web technology, so experience with Cordova/PhoneGap and HTML5 offline is highly valued, but not essential.

### Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in the Bay Area, California, but we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live.
