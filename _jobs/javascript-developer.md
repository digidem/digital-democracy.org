---

Digital Democracy is looking for a coder to join our small, agile team to build cutting-edge open source tools that marginalized communities around the world will use to document, map, monitor, manage and report information on environmental and human rights abuses.

We’ve seen firsthand that change does not come from technology, but from how people use it. We are building tools our partners will use to achieve transformative change and works toward a world where all people can participate in decisions that govern their lives. Equipped with the tools they need, our partners are becoming better storytellers, advocates and leaders.

###What we're looking for

We’re looking for a javascript developer full or part-time with experience building mobile apps with Cordova/PhoneGap and experience with frameworks like Backbone, Angular and Ember. Your primary scope of work will be to develop an offline mobile reporting platform our partners will use to document and monitor oil spills, gold mines and deforestation in Guyana, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil.

Digital Democracy is a small, high-impact team that takes a collaborative approach to tool-building and decision-making. In addition to the mobile reporting you will help shape the direction of the tools we are building and spend a portion of your time contributing code to other [open source server and client tools](https://github.com/digidem) we’re building in node/javascript.

###Apply if:

- You know and love javascript, not just jQuery.

- You’ve built an app with Cordova or PhoneGap, or have browsed the docs and figure you could easily apply your web app skills to mobile.

- You’ve used frameworks and libraries like Backbone, Angular, Ember, D3, React, Flux, or you have your own ideas about how to cleanly structure an app.

- You navigate Github and git like a pro, and diligently document your code and commits.

- You share our values, wanting to make a difference in the world working at a mission-driven organization. You believe solutions lie in listening to and working with and for local communities.

- You’re comfortable taking your own initiative working in a small team.

###Qualities we’re on the lookout for

- **Love of code**. Elegance is important to you, you spend time finding the simple, smarter solution rather than the complex, long way round. You value testing and creating reliable, maintainable code.

- **Interest in distributed systems**. You know about PouchDB, LevelUp, Scuttlebot, BitTorrent. Our tools need to work offline and synchronize without a central server.

- **Zeal for open source**. We have over [40 repositories on Github](https://github.com/digidem) and believe in building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.

- **Passionate about maps**. A lot of our work centers around the empowerment of making a map and their power as a [storytelling tool](http://www.giveclearwater.org/map/). You have experience building interactive maps and using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) tools.

- **Enthusiasm for design**. A listen-based, human-centered design process is at the heart of everything we do. The tools you build need to be easy to use for smart, fast learners who have maybe never touched a computer or smartphone before.

- **Hablas español**. You speak multiple languages, including Spanish. Not a requirement, but a plus for communicating with our end-users.

### Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in the Bay Area, California, but we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. Women and people of color strongly urged to apply. You will be reporting to the Program Director.

### Perks

- **Flexible schedule, location and hours**. As an organization we embrace working smarter, not harder. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live.

- Opportunity to **visit our partners in the field**. Our projects work because we build them with our partners. Although most of the job is desk based, in the future there will be opportunities to visit are partners in the field or participate in hackathons, like ones we have hosted in Haiti and the Peruvian rainforest.

- Opportunity to **play a leadership role at a ground-breaking organization**. Digital Democracy does excellent work because our team is excellent. When you work with us you won’t be treated like a code monkey, you’ll play a key role in architecting the larger toolkit we are building.

- **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience**, with flexible hours and opportunity to work where and when best fits your schedule.
