[Digital Democracy](https://www.digital-democracy.org/) is looking for a part-time UX Designer to join our small, agile team for an initial 3-month contract starting mid-August, with a view to joining our team long-term. You will help build cutting-edge open source tools for marginalized communities to document, map, monitor, manage and report information on environmental and human rights issues around the world.

We’ve seen firsthand that **change does not come from technology, but from how people use it**. We are building tools our partners are using to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern their lives.

## What we’re looking for

You will lead our design work on desktop and mobile apps for mapping and field reporting, to be used by indigenous communities worldwide. You have excellent people skills and are able to travel to lead workshops with our users, record their needs and requirements, and turn those into wireframes and clickable prototypes that can guide the work of our development team.

We are a small, high-impact team that takes a collaborative approach to tool-building and decision-making. Our tool development is led by our partner communities. As a designer you would take a leading role in determining how these tools solve the very real problems our partners are facing: Protection of the world’s forests and their ancestral homelands from deforestation and contamination. We need someone who can think creatively to solve these problems.

This is a part-time position of 20-30 hours per week (negotiable) that reports to the Program Director.

## The Role

* Work with our team and our partners in Guyana, Ecuador and Peru to understand what communities need technology to do, and how current technology creates barriers for them.

* Design wireframes, flows and screens for our mapping, monitoring and storytelling tools on desktop and mobile.

* Work with our team to think through how to tell interactive stories with maps and multimedia that help our partners tell their story to the world.

* You have strong visual design skills and experience designing user flows and interaction. Bonus points for HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, but they are not a requirement.

* You’re comfortable working with a small team and jumping in to help where needed.

## Qualities we’re on the lookout for

* **Focus on people**. A listening-based, human-centered design process is at the heart of everything we do. We’re seeking experience working with diverse communities and good facilitation skills.

* **Desire to change the world**. Our goal is that our tools help marginalized communities control their own futures and make a difference addressing threats like deforestation and human rights abuses.

* **Values based**. You share our belief in building tools that prioritize the self-determination and autonomy of our partners, and challenge legacies of colonization and extraction.

* **Zeal for open source**. We have over [100 repositories on Github](https://github.com/digidem) and believe in building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.

* **Passionate about maps**. Much of our work centers around making maps and their power as a [storytelling tool](http://www.giveclearwater.org/map/). You have experience building interactive maps and are familiar with [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) tools.

* **Hablas español**. You speak more than one language, ideally Spanish. Not a requirement, but a plus for communicating with our end-users.

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is mainly based in the Bay Area, California, but we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. The indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture. We need a team from diverse backgrounds that can understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Perks

* **Flexible schedule, location and hours**. As an organization we embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work from where you live, on a schedule that works for you.

*  Opportunity to **visit our partners in the field**. Our projects work because we build them with our partners. Although most of the job is desk based, this role will include travel to our partner communities for workshops, user testing and more.

* Opportunity to **play a leadership role at a ground-breaking organization**. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a small team.

* **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience**, with flexible hours and opportunity to work where and when best fits your schedule.

## How to apply

Send a note with the following to [jobs@digital-democracy.org](mailto:jobs@digital-democracy.org) **by August 6th**. We hope to hire by mid-August and will review applications as we receive them.

* Why you’re interested in designing tools at Digital Democracy.

* *Résumé* / CV

* Examples of your work and portfolio. Link to projects you’ve finished, or to your website.

* (Extra points) a story of an experience in work, travel or volunteering that has changed your perception of the world.
