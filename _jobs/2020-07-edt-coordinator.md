Digital Democracy is looking for a part-time Project Coordinator to join
our small, remote team on an eight month contract (with potential
long-term) starting as soon as possible.

You will help to prepare materials and oversee the launch of an online
learning platform for the “Earth Defenders Toolkit”, a collection of
open source tools for land rights and environmental monitoring for
Indigenous and rural communities around the world. You will work with
the Digital Democracy team to consolidate best practice in approaches
and tools that support Indigenous land defense, with the goal to create
a resource, including guides and training materials, that other
communities around the world can use.

You have excellent research, writing and project coordination skills and
you are passionate about social justice, decolonization and share our
[organisational values](https://www.digital-democracy.org/values/).

This is initially an eight month role, until the end of the current
project cycle, with possibility of extension. It is a part time role of
24 hours per week (negotiable).

## What we’re looking for

This role brings together many skills and capacities, and we do not
expect people to have experience in absolutely everything. We are
looking for someone who is a fast learner, open to learning new skills,
and also honest about those that they do not already have.

### Essential Skills and Experience

- **Project Coordination**: You will be driving established project
timelines for research and the creation of the Earth Defenders
Toolkit (ETD) website and digital materials, in collaboration with
the Dd team and contractors.

- **Research:** You will be compiling information and resource
gathering within Dd archives on specific tools including
[MAPEO](http://www.mapeo.app) as
well as interviewing Dd team members. You will also be on the
lookout for other tools that could be included within the project,
and this could involve interviews with institutional and community
partners.

### Desirable Skills

- **Meeting Facilitation:** You will be coordinating virtual
exchange events and meetings with institutional partners and
specified community contacts as well as drafting agendas and note
taking.

- **Writing:** You will be writing about the use of technology in a
way that is both informative and instructional for people who may
have minimal tech literacy, and are trying to find tools to defend
their lands and rights.

- **Content Creation:** You will create and organize content with
the support of a designer for the Earth Defender’s Toolkit. This
will include creation of easy to use training materials and
manuals.

- **Team Management:** there will be a team of people working
together on the Earth Defenders Toolkit site. At times you may be
the best placed person to manage contractors such as designers or
web developers.

## Qualities we’re on the lookout for

- **Precise.** You are a master of timing. You can take a project
timeline and make all the moving parts come together by
communicating clearly and identifying specifics to collaborators.

- **Concise.** You are able to take in a wide variety of
information, discern what is most relevant and prepare notes and
correspondence that helps inform the team for decision making.

- **Supportive.** You know how to facilitate people to share their
contributions and make sure the information gets where it is
needed to have an impact.

- **Organized.** You are good at making and maintaining impeccable
shared drives and can coordinate well prepared meetings with
people across multiple time zones.

- **Inspired.** You are excited about the use of technology in
communities as much as you are about Land Defenders realizing
their visions for their communities.

- **Values-based**. You share our belief in building tools that
prioritize the self-determination and autonomy of our partners,
and challenge legacies of colonialism.

- **Self-directed**. You are comfortable with managing your own
priorities and tasks in coordination with a small, remote team.

- **Hablas español**. You speak more than one language, ideally
Spanish. Not a requirement, but a plus for reviewing existing
documents and talking with some of our partners.

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in Oakland, CA; Washington, DC; New
York; Montreal, Canada; Abuja, Nigeria; London & Oxford, U.K. and we
welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We
embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where
you live.

The Indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization
and still deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and
discrimination against their languages and cultures. It is therefore
particularly important that we build a diverse team with individuals who
understand and empathize with their realities. Indigenous people, people
of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a
marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal
opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the
basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual
orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Perks

- **Flexible schedule, location and hours**. As an organization we
embrace working smarter, not harder. We are happy for you to work
from where you live, on a schedule that works for you and the
team.

- Opportunity to **play a key role in the creation of an information
platform with a ground-breaking organization**. You have the
opportunity to make a big impact in a small team.

- **Compensation and benefits commensurate with experience** (the
range for the role is $5,000 - 6,500 USD per month full-time
equivalent). We know that experience comes in many ways and we
want to know about what makes you stand out.

## How to apply

Send a note with the following by 9am UTC, August 10th*, to
[jobs+edt@digital-democracy.org](mailto:jobs+edt@digital-democracy.org) If we
are interested in talking further we will get in touch with you by August 20th.
