Digital Democracy is looking for an experienced React Native developer, who has experience working with iOS native APIs and Apple’s App Store Deployment, to deploy Mapeo Mobile to iOS. Mapeo is a cutting-edge open-source mobile and desktop mapping app using React Native and a peer-to-peer backend in Node (via nodejs-mobile).  Mapeo is primarily used by remote and marginalized communities to document, map, monitor, manage and report information on environmental and human rights issues around the world.

We’ve seen firsthand that change does not come from technology, but from how people use it. We are building tools our partners are using to achieve transformative change. We are dedicated to working towards a world where all people can participate in the decisions that govern their lives.

## What we’re looking for

You will work with our growing, small team of four engineers and designers to take our existing React Native App and deploy it to Apple’s App Store. This will include working with some native modules (including compiling C++ to iOS) and writing React-Native code specific to the iOS app. You will have experience in CI/CD using Expo App Services. And you are familiar with using Git for collaboration. This is a short-term, output-based contract, paid on completion of agreed milestones. Ideally we would like to see this work done within two months, but this can be negotiated.

We are a small, high-impact team that takes a collaborative approach to tool-building and decision-making. Our tool development is led by our partner communities. You would be building Mapeo Mobile on iOS that will be tested and used by our partners to confront real problems on the ground in the Amazon and around the world: Protection of the world’s forests and their ancestral homelands from deforestation and contamination. We need someone who can think creatively and collaboratively to solve these problems.

## The Work

* Get our existing React Native app (Mapeo Mobile), which already runs on Android, running on iOS
* Clean up the UI for iOS to address platform differences with Android
* Fix native modules to ensure they compile for iOS, including C++ modules linked to nodejs-mobile (used for our p2p backend)
* Create the CI/CD publishing flow to the Apple’s App Store for Mapeo Mobile using Expo Application Services.
* Upgrade our existing Expo Modules.
* Help to troubleshoot and bug fix on Mapeo iOS.

## Important traits for this role

* Have published one or more iOS apps in the app store
* Love of code. You love a challenge, value testing, and create maintainable code.
* Values-based. You share our belief in building tools that prioritize the autonomy of our partners, and challenge legacies of colonialism and extraction.
* Enthusiasm for open source. We have over 100 repositories on Github and believe in building open tools that others can contribute to and build upon.
* Self-directed. You are comfortable with managing your own priorities and tasks in coordination with a small, remote team.
* A no-ego approach and a willingness to learn and grow the team.
* Ability to speak more than one language, in particular Spanish or Portuguese

## Our Team

Our small but growing team is based in Montreal & Squamish, Canada; New York, DC Metro Area & Washington State, USA; Barcelona, Spain; Goiás, Brazil; Lima, Peru; Hastings & Edinburgh, U.K. and we welcome candidates from around the world, especially South America. We embrace distributed working, and are happy for you to work from where you live. The Indigenous communities we work with have lived through colonization and deal with its effects everyday, along with marginalization and discrimination against their language and culture. It is therefore particularly important that we build a diverse team with individuals who understand and empathize with their situation. Indigenous people, people of color, women, LGBTQ folk and others who identify as coming from a marginalized identity are strongly urged to apply. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

## Perks

* Opportunity to play a key role at a ground-breaking organization. You have the opportunity to make a big impact in a small team.
* Compensation: You quote us. After spending some time scoping out the work with us, we can work together to determine a compensation and time frame that would work best for you.
