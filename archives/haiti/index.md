Since before the devastating earthquake in January, 2010, Digital Democracy has been working on programs in Haiti ranging from youth photography trainings to harnessing technology to address gender-based violence (GBV).

Haiti is at a critical juncture, and Digital Democracy is working to support with a coalition of legal advocates, health and psycho-social providers, and Haitian women and girls to create a comprehensive response to the growing epidemic of violence against women. Our approach focuses on innovative uses of technology such as SMS messaging and new media to share critical information that will enable a more immediate and effective response from care providers, facilitate better documentation of incidents of violence, and strengthen advocacy efforts around security issues for women in Haiti.

Thanks to generous support from the United States Institute of Peace and Google, we are currently working with a coalition of grassroots groups to explore barriers to political participation for women around the elections scheduled for November 28th.  For ongoing updates from women participating in this initiative, please visit our blog at [FanmPale.blogspot.com][2].
